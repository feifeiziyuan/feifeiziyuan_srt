1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:01,533
假设我是网络
let's say I'm the web

2
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:03,366
我们在上一节中编写的服务器
server we wrote in the previous section

3
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:04,600
我是浏览器
and I'm a browser

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,833
假设我向您发送请求
and let's say I send you a request

5
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:08,833
好吧，我处理请求
well I handle the request

6
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,333
发回响应
send back a response

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,733
这很好用
and that works pretty good

8
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,733
如果我们只是偶尔收到请求
if we only get requests once in a while

9
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:16,933
但假设我们同时收到五个请求
but let's say we get five requests at the same time

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,200
好吧，现在我一次只能处理一个请求
well right now I can only handle one request at a time

11
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:21,700
所以我拿第一个
so I take the first one

12
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,066
发回回复 谢谢
send back a response thank you

13
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,666
拿第二个
take the second one

14
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:27,400
发回其响应
send back its response

15
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,433
但是当我收到第 5 个请求时
but by the time I get to this 5th request

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:30,666
好
well

17
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,933
它可能已经排了很长时间的队
it's potentially been waiting in line for a long time

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,500
我们得到的请求越多，这条线就越长
and the more requests we get the longer the line grows

19
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,766
这是我们服务器的瓶颈
here's that bottleneck in our server

20
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,833
在 hdp 的异常循环函数中的位置
where in the except loop function of the hdp

21
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,166
服务器文件，你会记得这个
server file and as you'll recall this

22
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,533
除了这里的函数是一个阻塞调用
except function here is a blocking call

23
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,233
它暂停执行
it suspends execution

24
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,633
在此侦听套接字上等待客户端连接
waiting for a client connection on this listen socket

25
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,366
当它接受新连接时
and when it accepts a new connection

26
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,500
然后客户端套接字将在这里绑定
then the client socket is going to get bound here

27
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,333
然后我们把它交给这个
and then we hand that off to this

28
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,533
在这里提供功能
serve function right here

29
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,266
这将是关于
which is going to go about the process of

30
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:03,400
实际处理请求并返回响应
actually handling the request and returning a response

31
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:06,500
所以我们必须等待这个服务函数返回
so we have to wait for this serve function to return

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,633
在我们可以再次调用 except 循环之前
before we can recurs calling except loop again

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,633
这使我们回到这条线
which takes us back up to this line

34
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,366
等待下一个客户端连接
waiting for the next client connection

35
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,400
所以让我们用一个请求来模拟这个问题
so let's simulate this problem with a request

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,666
这需要相对较长的时间来处理
that takes a relatively long time to handle

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,433
是的，我们将在此处的处理程序模块中完成此操作
yeah we'll do that over in the handler module here

38
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,966
我将在这里粘贴一条新路线
I'm going to paste in a new route up here

39
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,466
并且该路线称为休眠
and the route is called hibernate

40
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,200
因为这就是熊所做的
because that's what bears do

41
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:32,233
所以我们要在休眠斜杠上进行模式匹配
so we're going to pattern match on hibernate slash

42
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:32,700
接着
and then

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,400
我们想休眠一段时间
we want to hibernate for a certain amount of time

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,266
所以我们要绑定变量时间
so we're going to bind the variable time

45
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:39,733
到该网址中休眠后的任何数字
to whatever number comes after hibernate in that url

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,300
现在这将是一个字符串
now that's going to be a string

47
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,433
所以我们要花时间
so we're going to take the time

48
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,633
然后我们要管它
and then we're going to pipe it

49
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,966
将字符串转换为整数以将其转换为整数
into string to integer to convert it to an integer

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,933
然后我们想睡那段时间
and then we want to sleep for that amount of time

51
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,233
而earling有一个模块叫做
while earling has a module called

52
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:51,666
我们在那里调用的计时器
timer which we're calling right there

53
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,300
它有一个叫做睡眠的功能
it has a function called sleep

54
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,833
需要多少毫秒才能休眠
that takes the number of milliseconds to sleep

55
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,000
所以我们只是要插管
so we're just going to pipe in

56
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,200
那个时候进入睡眠功能
that time into the sleep function

57
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,233
我们学会了如何使用耳环
and we learned how to use an earling

58
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,966
上一节中的库
library in the previous section

59
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,466
然后我们就回去
then we're just going to return

60
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,566
状态码为 200 的响应
a response with the status code of 200

61
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,233
和尸体
and the bodies

62
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,033
只是想说
just going to say

63
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,133
嘿我醒了
hey I'm awake

64
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:10,900
现在稍微简化一下输出
now to simplify the output a bit

65
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,333
我要评论这个
I'm going to comment out this

66
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,500
在我们的管道中记录插件
log plugin up here in our pipeline

67
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,700
然后让我们继续启动我们的服务器
and then let's go ahead and fire up our server

68
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,200
我们做ix mix
we do ix mix

69
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,466
我们会说服务 hdp 服务器
we're going to say serve hdp server

70
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,700
开始，我们将再次在端口 4000 上启动它
start and we're going to start it on port 4000 again

71
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:27,866
好的，我们的服务器正在运行
okay we've got our server running

72
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,700
现在让我们尝试向它发送请求
now let's try sending it a request

73
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,233
所以回到这个
so back in this

74
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,433
终端会话就在这里，我将再次使用 curl
terminal session right here I'm going to use curl again

75
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:37,700
我要向 4000 api 斜线熊发送请求
I'm going to send a request to 4000 api slash bears

76
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,366
所以你注意到我们几乎立即得到回复
so you notice we get back a response almost immediately

77
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:42,666
服务器是
and the server is

78
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,466
现在等待接受下一个客户端连接
now waiting to accept the next client connection

79
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,166
所以现在在这个窗口中让我们发送一个请求
so now down in this window let's send a request

80
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,833
休眠所以我们要休眠 10,000
to hibernate so we're going to hibernate for 10,000

81
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,133
那是[&#39;十&#39;，&#39;千&#39;]毫秒
that's ['ten', 'thousand']millisecond

82
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,966
这将是 10 秒
that's going to be 10 seconds

83
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:55,866
好的，它正在冬眠
all right and it's hibernating

84
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:58,300
现在如果我们尝试运行 api 熊请求
now if we try to run the api bears request

85
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,733
好吧，我们没有立即得到回应
well we don't get an immediate response

86
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,200
这个挂了
this one's hung up

87
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,500
仍在做它的工作，而这个正在等待它
still doing its work and this one's waiting for it

88
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,600
一旦我们从中醒来
and as soon as we get back awake from that

89
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,733
长时间运行的请求
long running request

90
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,433
那么我们也得到了我们的 api 熊的响应
well then we also get the response for our api bears

91
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,933
所以它不会处理 api 请求，直到
so it doesn't handle the api request until

92
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,466
在休眠请求完成后
after the hibernate request has finished

93
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,366
是的，没错
yeah that's right

94
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,166
事实上，如果我们向上滚动，我们可以看到
in fact we can see that if we scroll up

95
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,733
在服务器输出中
in the server output up here

96
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,066
所以正在等待接受客户端连接
so is waiting to accept a client connection

97
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,200
我们发送了一个休眠 10,000 的请求
we sent in a request for hibernate 10,000

98
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,700
它收到了那个请求
it received that request

99
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,966
然后它发回响应
then it sent the response back

100
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,433
说它醒了
saying it was awake

101
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,966
然后它又回到等待
then it went back to waiting

102
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,366
用于下一个客户端连接
for the next client connection

103
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,900
该连接被接受，这就是
that connection was accepted and that was the

104
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,633
api 承载请求
api bears request

105
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,033
然后它继续
and then it went ahead

106
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,633
并为此发回响应
and sent the response back for that

107
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,933
所以如果我们回顾一下我们的代码
so if we look back at the code in our

108
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,466
此处的服务器，除了此处的行
server at this except line right here

109
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:52,066
如果客户端尝试连接到服务器
if a client tries to connect to the server

110
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,733
当它忙于处理一个长时间运行的请求时
while it's busy handling a long running request

111
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,533
这将在服务中处理
which is going to get handled in serve

112
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,700
然后连接请求被放置
then the connection request gets put

113
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,466
在所谓的积压 q
in what's called a backlog q

114
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,066
并告诉
and tell

115
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,400
服务器完成处理当前请求
the server finishes handling the current request

116
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,766
只有这样它才能循环回来
only then can it loop back

117
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,266
最多接受挂起的客户端连接
up to accept the pending client connection

118
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:12,066
因为我们一次只能接受一个连接
and because we can only accept one connection at a time

119
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,766
api 请求在 backlog 中停留了 10 秒
the api request sat in the backlog for 10 seconds

120
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,033
如果积压已满
and if the backlog fills up

121
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,400
默认情况下它最多只能容纳五个连接
by default it can only hold up to five connections

122
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,766
然后拒绝任何新连接
then any new connections are rejected

123
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,100
这不好
and this isn't good

124
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,033
我们需要修改服务器来处理
we need to modify the server to handle

125
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,133
多个请求同时进行
multiple requests concurrently

126
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,266
这样请求就不会延迟
so that requests don't get delayed

127
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,233
我们还有另一个问题需要解决
we also have another problem we need to address

128
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
假设一个异常被引发，而
let's say an exception gets raised while

129
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,733
处理请求
handling a request

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,833
好吧，我们将用一条新路线来模拟它
well we'll simulate that with a new route

131
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,100
我将把它粘贴到我们的休眠路线上方
and I'll just paste it in above our hibernate route

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,266
在处理程序中
here in the handler

133
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,233
这个请求的路径只是斜线kaboom
and the path to this request is just slash kaboom

134
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,600
然后我们使用
and then we use the

135
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,200
光线在这里起作用
rays function here

136
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,600
使用字符串 cab 引发异常
to raise an exception with the string cab

137
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,766
现在你可以防御性地添加
now you could defensively add

138
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:58,566
一些捕获此异常的异常处理
some exception handling that catches this exception

139
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,600
并返回 500 响应
and returns of 500 response

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,533
但我们现在就这样吧
but let's just go with this for now

141
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,666
是的，我会把它保存起来，然后回到这里
yeah I'll save that away and then back over here

142
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,200
我需要重启服务器
I need to restart the server

143
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,200
现在如果我们发送可以请求会发生什么
now what happens if we send that can request

144
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
所以我会下来
so I'll come down here

145
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,100
虽然我们在这里看到运行时错误
while we see the runtime error up here

146
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,866
在服务器日志驾驶室中
in the server log cab

147
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,966
你注意到我们回到了 ix session 终端
and you notice we're back at an ix session terminal

148
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,700
所以发送那个请求
so sending in that request

149
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,133
它关闭了整个网络服务器
it brought down the entire web server

150
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,200
如果我们来到这里并尝试运行请求
if we come here and we try to run a request

151
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,500
对于 api 熊
for api bears

152
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,900
好吧，它只是挂起
well it just hangs

153
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,366
很明显我们的服务器不是很容错
so clearly our server isn't very fault tolerant

154
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:36,000
仅处理一个请求的异常或任何故障
an exception or any failure handling just one request

155
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,666
使整个服务器陷入困境并影响所有人
makes the entire server go poof and impacts all

156
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,533
其他要求
other requests

157
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:44,400
所以我们需要一种方法来同时运行每个请求
so we need a way to run each request concurrently and

158
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,200
保持每个请求隔离
keep each request isolated

159
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,666
听起来有点棘手
that sounds kind of tricky

160
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,266
但实际上
but it's actually

161
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,733
使用长生不老药过程相当简单
fairly straightforward using elixir processes

162
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,400
事实上，这就是长生不老药真正闪耀的地方
in fact this is where elixir really shines

163
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,133
在接受循环函数中
in the accept loop function

164
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:57,600
我们有这个我们称之为接受的顺序代码
we have this sequential code we call accept

165
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:00,133
然后我们调用 serve 并等待它返回
and then we call serve and wait for it to return

166
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,466
然后我们再次调用接受循环
and then we call accept loop again

167
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,700
回避备份
which recuses back up

168
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:03,966
我们只是通过这里
and we just go through here

169
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,000
运行这些功能的锁定步骤
lock step running these functions

170
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,966
但我们想运行这个函数
but we want to run this function

171
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,100
这里的服务功能是一个单独的过程
this serve function right here is a separate process

172
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,800
异步而不是顺序
asynchronously rather than sequentially

173
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,700
那就对了
that's right

174
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,066
这样我们就可以接受任何新的客户端连接
that way we can accept any new client connections

175
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,566
其他请求同时
other requests while at the same time

176
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,500
处理当前请求
handling the current request

177
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,933
换句话说，我们可以同时处理请求
in other words we can handle requests concurrently

178
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,800
那么我们如何将代码作为一个单独的进程运行
so how do we run code as a separate process

179
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:30,766
好吧，我们使用 spawn 功能
well we use the spawn function

180
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,000
并且有两种方法可以调用 spawn 函数
and there are two ways to call the spawn function

181
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,833
使用匿名函数和命名函数
with an anonymous function and with a named function

182
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:38,000
让我们从一个匿名函数开始
let's just start with an anonymous function

183
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,500
我们会在我们的性爱会议上做这件事
and we'll do that over in our sex session

184
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,900
所以 spawn 是在上校模块中定义的
so spawn is defined in the colonel module

185
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,000
所以它会自动导入
so it's automatically imported

186
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,400
这意味着我们可以像这样调用 spawn
which means we can just call spawn like that

187
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,066
然后它需要一个匿名函数
and then it takes an anonymous function

188
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,000
所以我们将使用 fn
so we'll use fn

189
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:51,600
然后在那个函数里面
and then inside of that function

190
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,866
我们只是要打印出你好
we're just going to print out howdy

191
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:56,100
如果我点击返回
and if I hit return

192
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,433
当它运行这段代码时
while it ran this chunk of code

193
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:01,033
io 将我们置于单独的进程中
io put us howdy in a separate process

194
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:02,400
我们看到它打印出来了
and we see that it printed out

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
你好回到这里的性爱会议
howdy back here in sex session

196
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,066
我们也得到了一个叫做 pid 的东西
and we also got this thing called a pid

197
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:09,300
由 spawn 函数返回的
that was returned by the spawn function

198
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,833
并且 pid 是唯一标识符
and the pid is a unique identifier

199
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,366
运行的进程
of the process that ran

200
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,400
在这种情况下，它被处理了 166
in this case it was processed one sixty six

201
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,533
现在你的会有所不同，因为好吧
now yours is going to be different because well

202
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,066
这是一个不同的过程
it's a different process

203
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,833
现在让我们看一下这个的慢动作回放
now let's look at a slow motion replay of this

204
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:24,400
是的，让我们再做一次
yeah let's do it again

205
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,166
这次我想做一些改变
this time I want to make a couple changes

206
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,466
我想捕获pid
I want to capture the pid

207
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,266
所以我们要绑定
so we're going to bind

208
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,766
pid 到左侧的 pid 变量
the pid to the pid variable on the left hand side

209
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,966
然后在里面
and then inside

210
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,200
在打印你好之前在这里
here before printing howdy

211
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,033
我想睡5秒
I want to sleep for 5 seconds

212
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,533
所以我要调用那个定时器模块睡眠函数
so I'm going to call that timer module sleep function

213
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,333
再次
again

214
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,500
5000
5000

215
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,233
然后将多个表达式放在同一行
and then to put multiple expressions on the same line

216
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,000
我将在此处使用分号
I'm going to use a semicolon right there

217
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,166
这样我就不必做
that way I don't have to do

218
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,633
六个内的多行表达式
multiline expressions inside six

219
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,066
所以我们要睡5秒
so we're going to sleep for 5 seconds

220
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,300
然后打印出你好
and then print out howdy

221
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,800
如果我们点击返回
and if we hit return

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,500
当我们立即得到 pid 时，它是 pid 170
while we immediately get the pid back it's pid 170

223
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,733
然后这个过程正在进行中
and then the process is working on

224
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,600
这个匿名函数，所以它睡了 5 秒
this anonymous function so it slept for 5 seconds

225
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,633
然后当它完成时它打印出你好
and then when it was done it printed howdy

226
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,033
我们在这里看到了
and we see that right here

227
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,400
所以让我们再试一次
so let's try that again

228
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,033
这次我要改成10秒
this time I'm going to change it to 10 seconds

229
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,966
然后我们可以检查它是否正在运行
and then we can check that it's running

230
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,700
Elixir 中有一个流程模块，并且有一个 live
there's a process module in elixir and there's a live

231
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,600
问号功能
question mark function

232
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,233
我们可以调用并传递 pid
we can call and pass it the pid

233
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,233
它还活着
it's alive still alive

234
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:18,433
还活着
still alive

235
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,233
哎呀，现在我们回来了，你好，它还活着吗
oop now we get back howdy so is it alive

236
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:24,133
不，现在进程已经死了
no now the process has died

237
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,633
它打印出了你好，它不再活着
it printed out howdy and it's no longer alive

238
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,400
运行匿名函数后
after running the anonymous function

239
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,066
生成过程已退出
the spawn process exited

240
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,766
稍后我们将看到如何使用 pid
a bit later we'll see how to use the pid

241
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,833
作为向进程发送消息的地址
as an address to send messages to a process

242
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,900
但是现在让我们回到我们最初的问题
but for now let's go back to our original problem

243
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,400
是的，您可能会看到它的发展方向
yeah you probably see where this is heading

244
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,533
我们说我们想运行这个服务功能
we said we wanted to run this serve function

245
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,933
在一个单独的过程中
in a separate process

246
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,266
现在我们知道该怎么做
and now we know how to do that

247
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,033
我们只是要产生一个进程
we're just going to spawn a process

248
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,533
我们将放置一个匿名函数
we're going to put an anonymous function

249
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,766
就这样调用服务
call serve just like that

250
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,866
在这种情况下，我们不需要 pid
and in this case we don't need the pid

251
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,833
所以我不会在左侧绑定它
so I'm not going to bind to it on the left hand side

252
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,300
所以现在一旦我们在这里接受了客户端连接
so now once we've accepted a client connection here

253
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
我们只是要产生一个新的过程
we're just going to spawn a new process to

254
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,366
处理请求
handle the request

255
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,966
这意味着我们要撤退
which means we're going to drop back

256
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,133
进入这个接受循环
into this accept loop

257
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,933
很快，因为这将运行
pretty quickly because this is going to run

258
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,566
在后台异步
asynchronously in the background

259
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,566
事实上，因为它在后台运行
in fact since it's running in the background

260
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,000
我要添加一些输出
I'm going to add some output

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,366
在这里服务
down here and serve

262
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,366
因为这会得到
because this is going to get

263
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,933
在那个单独的进程中运行
run in that separate process

264
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,866
我们只想看看 pid 是什么
and we just want to see what pid is

265
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,300
实际上做所有这些工作
actually doing all this work

266
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,766
所以我要使用它
so I'm going to use it

267
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,900
我想打印过程的坑
and I want to print the pit of the process

268
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,100
正在运行此功能
that's running this function

269
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,066
你可以这样做的方法是调用 self
and the way you can do that is call self

270
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,133
即返回当前进程的坑
that returns the pit of the current process

271
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,766
然后我需要对它进行插值
and then I'm going to need to interpolate it

272
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,666
像那样和我们要显示的pid结构
like that and the pid structure we want to display

273
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,500
只是以某种容易看到的方式
just in some way that's easy to see

274
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,133
所以我要使用检查
and so I'm going to use inspect

275
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,500
所以我们要检查 pid
so we're going to inspect the pid

276
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,100
这将基本上给我们我们在 ix 中看到的内容
that's going to give us basically what we saw in ix

277
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,300
然后我只想说
and then I'm just going to say

278
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:49,600
正在努力
working on it

279
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:51,766
现在一旦我们产生了这个
now once we've spawned this

280
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,700
过程将完全靠自己
process it's going to be all on its own

281
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,533
我们基本上可以忘记生成过程
we can essentially forget about the spawn process

282
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
因为它可以访问这个客户端套接字
because it has access to this client socket

283
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,766
它通过它
through which it

284
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,533
将 hdp 响应发送回浏览器
sends the hdp response back to the browser

285
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,000
一旦得到回应
and once the response has been

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,033
在进程即将退出时发送
sent while the process is going to exit

287
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,166
那么当我们产生一个进程时会发生什么
so what happens when we spawn a process that

288
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,300
不使用套接字
doesn't use a socket

289
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
这是一个更常见的情况
which is a more common scenario

290
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,166
好吧，我们将在下一节中讨论
well we'll look at that in the next section

291
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,766
现在让我们重新开始
for now let's just get a clean slate

292
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,200
通过重新启动它和服务器
by restarting it and the server

293
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,033
现在让我们再次尝试该休眠请求
now let's try that hibernate request again

294
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,933
我们将休眠 10 秒
we'll hibernate for 10 seconds

295
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:26,533
如果我们在这里抬头
if we look up here

296
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,833
我们看到我们接受客户端连接
we see we accept a client connection

297
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,733
但它几乎立刻又回来了
but it almost immediately comes back

298
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,000
并开始等待下一个客户端连接
and starts waiting for the next client connection

299
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,400
即使这个休眠请求仍在运行
even though this hibernate request is still running

300
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:39,033
所以现在让我们再次发送休眠请求
so now let's send the hibernate request again

301
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:40,000
和
and

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,300
在一个单独的窗口中，我们将发送我们的 api 请求
in a separate window we'll send a request for our api

303
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,100
你看
and you see

304
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,566
我们的 api 立即得到回复
we get a response back immediately for our api

305
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,866
在我们的休眠请求完成之前
before our hibernate request even finishes

306
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,933
那是因为 api 请求
and that's because the api request

307
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,200
被单独处理
was handled in a separate

308
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,466
并发进程
concurrent process

309
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,300
所以现在发送我们的出租车请求
so sending our cab request now

310
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,166
不应影响服务器或任何其他请求
shouldn't affect the server or any other requests

311
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,266
是的，在服务器窗口中
yeah up in the server window

312
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,966
我们看到引发了异常
we see that the exception got raised

313
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,233
出租车就在这里
here's cab right here

314
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,466
但是您注意到我们没有返回到税务会话提示
but you notice we don't return to an tax session prompt

315
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,233
因为服务器不受影响
because the server isn't affected

316
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:14,100
它仍在运行，实际上它仍在响应
it's still running and in fact it's still responsive

317
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:17,033
我们可以发送请求，所以我要发送一个
we can send requests in so I'm going to send one in for

318
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,333
只是熊
just bears

319
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,433
正确的得到了那个请求并得到了回复
right got that request and got a response right back

320
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,900
或 api 熊
or api bears

321
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
服务器仍在响应其他请求
the server still responding to other requests

322
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,500
如果我们在服务器中向上滚动
and if we scroll up in the server

323
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,333
我们应该看到
we should see the

324
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,266
处理这些请求的进程的投标
bids of the processes that handled those requests

325
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,833
所以这里进程 170 正在处理它
so here process 170 was working on it

326
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,033
这里进程一六十九正在处理它
here process one sixty nine was working on it

327
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,133
我想你明白了
and I think you get the point

328
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:44,133
每个请求都由不同的进程处理
each request was handled by a different process

329
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,833
这很酷
this is pretty cool

330
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,333
每个客户端连接都有自己的
every client connection gets its own

331
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,633
隔离一个请求失败的过程
process isolating the failure of one request

332
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,033
从另一个是的
from another yeah

333
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,966
只需将一些现有代码包装在 spawn 中
simply by wrapping some existing code in a spawn

334
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,900
运行我们的网络服务器现在更容错
function our web servers now more fault tolerate

335
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,833
并且可以同时处理多个请求
and can handle multiple requests concurrently
