1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:00,966
在这个模块中
in this module

2
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,466
我们将看看如何编写自动化
we're going to look at how to write automated

3
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:03,533
长生不老药中的测试
tests in elixir

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,533
但这里有一些事情
but here's some things

5
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:06,433
我们不会在这个模块中做
we're not going to do in this module

6
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,733
我们不会试图说服你测试是
we're not going to try to convince you that testing is

7
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,400
重要的是，我们假设您已经知道
important we assume you already know that

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,700
我们也不去
we're also not going

9
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,700
如果你不是，让你感到羞耻
to shame you if you're not

10
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,266
做洗手间和发展
doing restroom and development

11
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,500
或者没有 100% 的测试覆盖率
or don't have 100% test coverage

12
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,100
事实上，我们根本不会宣扬测试教条
in fact we're not going to preach testing dogma at all

13
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:22,200
我们假设
we're going to assume

14
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,866
你已经使用了一个单元测试框架
you've used a unit testing framework in

15
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,666
另一种语言
another language

16
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,900
并且您想知道如何在 elixir 中进行测试
and you want to know how to test in elixir

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,100
现在我们在处理程序的底部有这段代码
right now we have this code at the bottom of handler

18
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,533
向句柄函数发送请求
that sends request to the handle function

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
并打印出响应
and prints out the responses

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,100
因此，当我们在 ix 会话中重新编译调查处理程序时
so when we recompile survey handler in an ix session

21
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,466
该代码运行，我们看到请求和响应
that code is run and we see the requests and responses

22
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,600
所以本质上我们只是视觉上的
so in essence we're just visually

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,666
测试，我在这里使用空中报价
testing and I'm using air quotes here

24
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,166
每个请求都有效
that each request works

25
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
你可能猜到了
and as you might guess

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,533
有更好的测试方法
there's a better way to do testing

27
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,833
当我们使用 mix 创建一个新的 elixir 项目时
when we created a new elixir project using mix

28
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,733
新的服务组合足够大胆
new service mix was presumptuous enough to

29
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:01,833
还生成一个测试目录
also generate a test directory

30
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,566
它里面有两个文件
and it has two files in it

31
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:07,366
测试助手 exs 和服务测试 exs
test helper exs and service test exs

32
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,366
测试文件是长生不老药脚本
the test files are elixir scripts

33
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,000
这就是性延伸
that's the sex extension

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,100
这意味着它们不必被编译
which means they don't have to be compiled

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,100
在他们跑步之前
before their run

36
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,166
如果我们查看测试助手
and if we look in test helper

37
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,900
好吧，我们看到它开始了
well we see that it starts

38
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,800
ex unit 和 ex unit 是 Elixir 内置的
ex unit and ex unit is elixir's built in

39
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,666
测试框架
test framework

40
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,333
那么如果我们看看调查测试
then if we have a look in survey test

41
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,366
好吧，有一个模块叫做调查测试
well there's a module called survey test

42
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:30,066
第一行说使用单位案例
and this first line says use ex unit case

43
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:33,466
使用添加测试功能或行为
use adds the testing functionality or behavior

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,733
在这个 ex unit case 模块中定义
that's defined in this ex unit case module

45
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,166
并将该行为添加到当前模块
and it adds that behavior to the current module

46
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,466
这是我们的调查测试
which is our survey test

47
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,066
第二行是这个
the 2nd line is this

48
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,533
停靠测试，我们将在一分钟内回到那个
dock test and we'll come back to that in just a minute

49
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,100
然后我们有定义测试的测试宏
then we have the testing macro which defines a test

50
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,200
然后有一个字符串的描述
and then there's a description as a string

51
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,566
和一段代码
and a block of code

52
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,266
然后在代码块内
and then inside of the block of code

53
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,033
我们陈述我们的期望
we state our expectations

54
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,966
使用这个断言宏
using this assert macro

55
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:00,333
只是测试这个表达是真的
was just test that this expression is truth

56
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:03,000
所以我们断言 1+1 等于 2
so we're asserting that 1+1 equals two

57
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,600
assert 的反义词叫做 refute
the opposite of assert is something called refute

58
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,766
所以我们可以反驳 2+1 等于 2
so we could refute that 2+1 equals two

59
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,000
因为那不是真的
because that's not true

60
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,433
通常这些
and generally these

61
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,533
两个宏都是
two macros are all

62
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,500
你需要做测试
you need to do testing

63
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,600
因为你要么会断言
because you're either going to assert that

64
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,500
某事是真的
something's true

65
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,100
或者你要反驳某事
or you're going to refute something

66
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,366
好吧，我现在要摆脱这个
all right I'm going to get rid of this for now

67
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
所以让我们继续运行这个测试
so let's go ahead and run this test

68
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,933
我在调查目录中
I'm in the survey directory

69
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,333
我们使用
and we run the test by using

70
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,800
混合测试，然后我们给它测试文件的名称
mix test and then we give it the name of the test file

71
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
所以它会是
so it's going to be

72
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,833
测试调查测试前
test survey test ex

73
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,033
毫不奇怪它成功了
and no surprise it succeeds

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,566
现在
now

75
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:37,133
让我们让它失败只是为了看看输出如何变化
let's make it fail just to see how the output changes

76
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,100
所以我们断言 1+1 等于
so we'll assert that 1+1 equals

77
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,900
三
three

78
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,166
再次运行测试
run the test again

79
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,466
你在这里向上滚动一点
you scroll up a little bit here

80
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,066
断言宏的好处是
well what's nice about the assert macro is

81
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,433
它内省代码
it introspects the code

82
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,100
给我们一些有用的反馈
to give us some helpful feedback

83
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,866
它向我们展示了在这里失败的断言
it shows us the assertion that failed right here

84
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,233
这是期望值二
this is the expected value two

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,466
然后这是实际值三
and then this is the actual value three

86
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,366
很酷，所以让我们继续把它改回
cool so let's go ahead and change it back to a

87
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,266
通过状态
passing state

88
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,000
我们去吧
there we go

89
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,733
所以我们不要编写自己的单元测试
so let's not write our own unit test

90
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,033
帮助我们开始
to help us get started

91
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,933
让我们复制这段代码
let's copy this code

92
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,466
然后我们可以为我们的解析器创建一个测试用例
and then we can create a test case for our parser

93
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,500
命名解析器下划线测试
named parser underscore test

94
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,566
我将粘贴我们拥有的代码
and I'll just paste in the code that we have

95
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,733
我们将把模块从
and we're going to change the module from

96
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,700
调查测试到解析器测试
survey test to parser test

97
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,766
我还将更改此文档测试以服务解析器
I'm also going to change this doc test to serve parser

98
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:29,933
我们会在一分钟内回到那个
and we'll come back to that in a minute

99
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,266
我们还需要在解析器中使用别名
we also need to alias in the parser

100
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,700
因为这就是我们要测试的
since that's what we're going to test

101
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,733
那么我们应该在解析器中测试什么
so what should we test in the parser

102
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,500
好吧，让我们看看解析器 ex
well let's have a look at that in parser ex

103
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,200
在我们结束兴趣之前
well before we get to our end to interest

104
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:44,000
让我们向他们展示两种编写单元测试的方法
let's show them two ways to write unit tests

105
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,966
是的，我们有一些递归
yeah we've got some recursion going

106
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,033
在这里，当我们解析标题时
on here when we're parsing the headers

107
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,100
所以让我们为这些函数编写一个单元测试
so let's write a unit test for these functions

108
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:52,500
你会记得这个功能
you'll remember this function

109
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,333
它需要一个
it takes a

110
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,433
头部和尾部的标题行列表
list of header lines that's the head and the tail

111
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,200
然后我们要解析那些
and then we want to parse those

112
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,066
进入包含键值对的映射，所以
into a map that contains key value pairs so

113
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,333
这将是标题
it'll be the headers

114
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,966
所以我们可以为此编写一个测试
so we can write a test for that

115
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,833
回到解析器测试
come back over to parser test

116
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,266
在此处更改描述
change the description here

117
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,366
解析头字段列表
parses a list of header fields

118
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,333
进入地图
into a map

119
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,933
摆脱这个，让我们设置一些标题行
get rid of this so let's set up some header lines

120
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,666
这将是一个看起来像这样的列表
it's going to be a list that looks like this

121
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,933
标头 a 的值可能为 1
the header a might have a value of one

122
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,533
然后标题 b 的值可能为 2
and then the header b might have a value of two

123
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,300
现在实际的标题有
now the actual headers have

124
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,900
不同的键和值，但 a one 和 b two 工作
different keys and values but a one and b two work

125
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,233
适合这里的测试
just fine for the test here

126
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,166
然后我们想改变这个
then we want to transform this

127
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,333
进入标题映射，我们通过调用解析器来做到这一点
into a map of headers and we do that by calling parser

128
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
解析标头
parse headers

129
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,800
我们传入标题行
we pass in the header lines

130
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:44,066
和一张这样的空地图
and an empty map like that

131
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,200
那么我们期望返回到标题看起来像什么
so what do we expect to return to headers to look like

132
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
好吧，我们可以使用 assert 宏并说我们断言
well we can use the assert macro and say we assert

133
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,800
标题等于地图
the headers equal a map

134
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,400
有一个键
that has a key of a

135
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,066
和一个值
and a value of one

136
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,666
和 b 的键
and a key of b

137
00:04:59,133 --> 00:04:59,966
两个的值
the value of two

138
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,100
所以我们希望它解析这个行列表
so we expect it to parse this list of lines

139
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,766
成键值对
into key value pairs

140
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,266
如果我们把它保存起来
if we save that away

141
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,500
然后运行它，我们将像以前一样执行它
then to run it we'll do it just like before

142
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,433
除了我们要给它解析器测试
except we're going to give it parser test

143
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,166
看起来有效
it looks like it works

144
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,166
断言宏是
the assert macro is

145
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,600
实际上非常聪明地帮助你弄清楚
actually pretty smart about helping you figure out

146
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,433
为什么断言失败
why an assertion is failing

147
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,366
所以让我们说
so let's say

148
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,400
我们从我们的预期中删除一个关键值
that we remove one of the key values from our expected

149
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,500
map 然后我们重新运行我们的测试
map and then we rerun our tests

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,066
好吧，它失败了
well it fails

151
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,100
它告诉我们为什么我们看到左边的地图
and it tells us why we see the map on the left

152
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,300
与右边的地图不匹配
doesn't match the map on the right

153
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,300
因为左边那个
because the one on the left

154
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,100
也有一个键 b 和一个值二
also has a key b and a value of two

155
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,800
所以我们缺少一个关键值
so we're missing a key value

156
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,533
所以我就把它改回来，这样我们就可以通过测试了
so I'll just change that back so we have a passing test

157
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,533
好了，这是编写单元测试的一种方法
there we go so that's one way to write unit tests

158
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,500
但不是将它们放在单独的文件中
but instead of putting them in a separate file

159
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,400
我们可以写点东西
we can write something

160
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,133
称为文档测试
called doc tests

161
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,800
所以让我们回到我们的教区
so let's go back to our parish

162
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,766
我们已经测试过了
we've got this tested

163
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,200
但是这个解析的段落就在这里
but what about this parsed para right here

164
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,333
我将粘贴一些文档
I'm going to paste in a little bit of documentation

165
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,133
在顶部
at the top

166
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,533
我们已经知道如何使用
we already know how to use

167
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:07,900
在码头上记录一个函数的作用
at dock to document what a function does like this

168
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,833
包含以下示例也很有帮助
it's also helpful to include examples of

169
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,233
如何使用该功能
how to use the function

170
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,600
按照惯例
and by convention

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,966
这些示例显示在这样的 ix 会话中
those examples are shown in an ix session like this

172
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:17,900
现在
now

173
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,066
这个配色方案有点难看
this is a bit difficult to see with this color scheme

174
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:21,466
所以我只是不寻常的这些
so i'm just going to uncommon these

175
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,000
一分钟以获得不同的颜色
for a minute to get a different color

176
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,400
现在首先要注意的是我们写
now the first thing to note is that we write

177
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,666
长生不老药文档
elixir documentation

178
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,600
使用降价
using markdown

179
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,266
你注意到这里的双重哈希
you notice this double hash here

180
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,000
这将产生一个 h 2
that's going to generate an h two

181
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,366
你也会注意到我们在这里的代码
and you also notice that the code that we have up here

182
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:34,666
对于键和值
for keys and values

183
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,766
进入单个反引号内
goes inside of single back ticks

184
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,666
然后这部分被称为讲解员
and then this part is called the docent

185
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,866
它基本上是一组期望
and it's basically a set of expectations

186
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:45,133
或关于我们的代码如何工作的断言
or assertions about how our code is intended to work

187
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,400
所以如果我们有一个看起来像这样的参数字符串
so if we have a param string that looks like this

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,666
然后我们调用serve parser pars para
and then we call serve parser pars para

189
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,433
这是它的第一个参数
this is the first parameter to it

190
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,300
然后第二个参数是我们的参数字符串
and then the second parameter is our param string

191
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,733
好吧，我们期望什么
well what do we expect

192
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,500
好吧，我们希望 ix 返回一个看起来像这样的地图
well we expect ix to return a map that looks like this

193
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,033
它从这里获取名称和类型
it took the name and the type from here

194
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,500
并将其放入地图中
and put it inside of a map

195
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,033
然后如果我们用 parse para 调用
and then if we call parse para with

196
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,166
多部分表单数据作为第一个参数
multipart form data as the first parameter

197
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,100
param string 是第二个参数
and param string is the second parameter

198
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,500
好吧，我们不处理
well we don't handle

199
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,633
这种格式，所以我们希望回到
this format so we expect to get back in

200
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:16,433
空地图
empty map

201
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,166
现在如果我们能跑起来岂不是很酷
now wouldn't it be cool if we could run

202
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,533
这些例子和检查
these examples and check

203
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,233
函数返回的实际值
that the actual value returned by the function

204
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,500
匹配注释中显示的值
matches the values shown in the comment

205
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,666
想象一下，这正是这条讲解路线
imagine that well that's exactly what this docent line

206
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,666
在解析器测试中完成
over in parser test does

207
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,966
这是一个寻找的宏
it's a macro that looks for

208
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,933
本模块调查解析器中的讲解员
docents in this module survey parser

209
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,333
如果它找到了讲解员，那么它会为他们生成测试
and if it finds docent then it generates tests for them

210
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,033
所以因为我们已经有了这条线
so because we already have this line

211
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,366
我们在这里进行了码头测试
and we've got this dock test over here

212
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,600
我只需要
I just need to

213
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,266
以应有的方式发表评论
comment this the way it should be

214
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,333
所以这是一个实际的码头测试
so it's an actual dock test

215
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,766
像这样把它保存起来
like that save it away

216
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,000
现在如果我们来到这里再次运行解析器测试
now if we come down here and run parser test again

217
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,266
现在我们有两个测试
well now we have two tests

218
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,633
我们通常编写的单元测试之一
one of the unit tests we wrote conventionally

219
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,100
并且其中一项测试是从
and one of the tests got generated from

220
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,066
这个码头测试
this dock test

221
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
现在只是为了表明这是一个实际的测试
now just to show that this is an actual test

222
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
让它失败
let's make it fail

223
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,466
我会将这种类型更改为颜色
I'll change this type to a color

224
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:14,666
果然失败了
and sure enough it fails

225
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,266
就像任何其他单元测试一样
just like any other unit test would

226
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,033
所以让我们继续把它改回来
so let's go ahead and change that back

227
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,533
这真的很酷的是我们
what's really cool about this is we

228
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,533
一直都知道dock test中的例子是
always know that the examples in the dock test are

229
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,266
最新的，他们从不撒谎，这是你的事
up to date and they never lie which is something you

230
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,000
总是希望在文档中
always hope for in documentation

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
但不要总是得到
but don't always get

232
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,966
所以现在我们有两个测试文件
so now we have two test files

233
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,733
我们可以一口气运行这些测试
and we can run those tests in one swoop

234
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,300
我们只是通过使用来做到这一点
we just do that by using

235
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,866
混合测试而不给它一个文件名
mix test and not giving it a file name

236
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,666
我们看到我们有三个测试
we see that we have three tests

237
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,200
我们已经进行了解析器测试，然后进行了调查测试
we've got our parser tests and then survey tests

238
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,500
混合测试所做的只是在
and what mix test did is it just looked in the

239
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,533
测试目录在这里
test directory here

240
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,500
它找到了所有以下划线测试结尾的文件
and it found all the files ending in underscore tests

241
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,566
前它继续运行那些
ex and it went ahead and ran those

242
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,333
现在我们知道如何编写测试了
now that we know how to write tests

243
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,200
让我们回到最初的目标
let's return to our original goal

244
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:57,633
这是要转换
which was to convert

245
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:00,666
此代码位于句柄模块的底部
this code at the bottom of the handle module

246
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,866
进入自动化测试
into automated tests

247
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,666
让我们从删除这些开始
let's start by deleting these

248
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,433
因为我们不想要这个
because we don't want this

249
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,400
当我们运行我们的应用程序时执行的代码
code executing when we run our app

250
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,600
所以我们要深入到最底层
so we're just going to go down to the very bottom

251
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,600
在这里抓住所有这些东西
grab all this stuff here

252
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,666
到那里并把它消灭掉
to there and zap it out

253
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,766
我要创建一个新的测试文件
I'm going to create a new test file

254
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:17,833
测试目录下
under the test directory

255
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:21,266
它将被称为 handler test exs
it's going to be called handler test exs

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,066
我现在要粘贴我们的第一个结束测试
and I'm going to paste in our first end end test now

257
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,633
不用担心在这个测试中输入
don't worry about typing in this test

258
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,833
你真的会找到它
you'll actually find it

259
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,266
以及代码包中的所有其他测试
as well as all the other tests in the code bundle

260
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,533
它被称为处理程序测试
it's called handler test

261
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,166
又是这条使用线
there's this use line again

262
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,100
然后我们有这条导入线
and then we have this import line

263
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,966
我们在这里要做的是导入这个
what we're going to do here is import this

264
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:38,966
句柄函数
handle function

265
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,333
只是为了在这个模块内部很容易使用
just so it's easy to use inside of this module

266
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,300
然后我们在这里使用我们的测试宏
then we use our test macro here

267
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,600
我们的描述是
and our description is

268
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,433
这是为了获得一些狂野的东西
this is for a get of wild things

269
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,733
我们有我们的代码块
we've got our code block

270
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,533
所以我们在代码块中所做的是
so what we do inside the code block is

271
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,700
我们建立了一个请求
we set up a request

272
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:51,900
使用听码头
using a hear dock

273
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,400
我们通过请求
we pass the request

274
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,366
进入我们的句柄函数，这是服务处理程序句柄
into our handle function this is serve handler handle

275
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,866
我们得到回复
we get back a response

276
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,700
然后我们将使用 assert 宏
and then we're going to use the assert macro

277
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,900
断言该响应等于
to assert that that response equals

278
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,300
另一个听到码头，这是我们的回应
another hear dock which is our response

279
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,133
现在你可能想知道
now you might be wondering

280
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:11,166
行尾的这些字符是什么
what's with these characters at the end of the lines

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,366
以及http规范
well the http spec

282
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,833
实际上需要这些行结束
actually requires these lines to end

283
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,066
在作为反斜杠 r 的回车换行符中
in a carriage return line feed which is backslash r

284
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,133
反斜杠 n
backslash n

285
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,800
现在发坞隐含地给了我们反斜杠 n
now the hair dock implicitly gives us the backslash n

286
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,966
在每一行的末尾
at the end of each line

287
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:28,033
但我们必须明确添加反斜杠 r
but we have to explicitly add the backslash r

288
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,866
所以你会在这些行的末尾看到
so you see that at the end of these lines

289
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,066
以同样的方式
in the same way

290
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,066
规范还要求
the spec also requires

291
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,233
响应行上的反斜杠 r 反斜杠 n
backslash r backslash n on the response lines

292
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,566
所以我们在这里添加了这些
so we've added those here

293
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:39,800
现在这有点
now this is a bit

294
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,533
迂腐，但消息正文在此处的最后一行
pedantic but the message body this last line here

295
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,766
不必有反斜杠 r
doesn't have to have a backslash r

296
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,133
所以你在那里看不到一个
so you don't see one there

297
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,433
我们不希望这些早点妨碍
we didn't want these to get in the way earlier

298
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,200
他们看起来有点讨厌
they do kind of look obnoxious

299
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,266
但稍后会从浏览器发送请求
but a bit later will send requests from a browser

300
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:56,066
他们将采用这种格式
and they'll be in this format

301
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,300
所以我们现在不妨考虑这些角色
so we might as well account for these characters now

302
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,433
所以让我们看看这个测试是否有效
so let's see if this test works

303
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,566
混合测试
mix test

304
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,500
处理程序测试前
handler test ex

305
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,400
看起来我们有问题
and it looks like we have a problem

306
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,300
如果我们在这里向上滚动
if we scroll up here

307
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,933
虽然我们看到右侧值不匹配
while we see no match the right side value

308
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:16,933
得到狂野的东西
get wild things

309
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,166
注意我们看到这些
and notice we see these

310
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:22,766
反斜杠 r 反斜杠在此处结束
backslash r backslash ends throughout here

311
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,033
因为这就是我们的要求
because that's what our request has

312
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,766
但这不是我们的解析器所期望的
but that's not what our parser's expecting

313
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,700
所以我们回到解析器
so we go back over to the parser

314
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,766
这里的最高点
the very top here

315
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,566
我们分开
we split on

316
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,766
斜线很好，这实际上是
slash n well this is actually going to be

317
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,033
反斜杠 r 反斜杠 n
backslash r backslash n

318
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,566
反斜杠 r 反斜杠 n
backslash r backslash n

319
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,166
将顶部与婴儿车字符串分开
that separates the top from the pram strings

320
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,166
以同样的方式
in the same way

321
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,966
所有最上面的行都有一个反斜杠 r 反斜杠 n
all the top lines will have a backslash r backslash n

322
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,600
以便修复解析器但在处理程序中
so that fixes the parser but over in the handler

323
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,633
我们还需要改变这个格式响应函数
we also need to change this format response function

324
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,400
包括反斜杠 r
to include backslash r

325
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,833
在这些行的末尾
at the end of these lines

326
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,566
现在我们的测试应该通过了
and now our test should pass

327
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
下来这里
come down here

328
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,166
再次运行它，果然他们通过了
run it again sure enough they pass

329
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,533
已经只有七个测试要写了
already so only seven more tests to write

330
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,266
准备好你的手指
get your fingers ready

331
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:10,433
只是在开玩笑
just kidding

332
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,233
我们不会让你受苦
we're not going to make you suffer through that

333
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,733
我们只是要一次又一次地粘贴它们
we're just going to paste them in and again

334
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,433
您可以在代码包中找到所有测试
you can find all the tests in the code bundle

335
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,733
这是我们刚刚编写的测试
so here's the test that we just wrote

336
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,766
然后我们在它下面粘贴了一些测试
and then we pasted some tests beneath it

337
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,666
所以这是一个用于获得斜线熊的
so here's one for get slash bears

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,133
我们设置了请求
we set up the request

339
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,800
我们调用句柄得到响应
we call handle get a response to that

340
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,466
我做了这个有点不同
and I did this one a little bit differently

341
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,666
注意我说预期响应等于
notice I say expected response equals

342
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,900
然后我们有一个听码头
and then we have a hear dock

343
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,866
然后我们有我们期望的标题
and then we have the headers we would expect

344
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
然后是内容
and then the content

345
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,733
记住从模板生成
remembers generated from a template

346
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:42,866
这就是模板生成的所有内容
so this is all that template generated content

347
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,433
因为那个模板可以有不同的
and because that template can have different

348
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,300
里面的空白
white space in it

349
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,033
有时很难断言
and sometimes it's difficult to assert

350
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,100
基于空白
based on white space

351
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,533
我写了一个小函数
I wrote a little function down

352
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,066
下面称为删除右空间
below called remove right space

353
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,666
所以我们只在响应中调用删除空格
so we just call remove white space on the response

354
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,866
那应该等于
and that should equal

355
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,733
相当于我们预期的反应
the equivalent of our expected response

356
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,133
我们使用 assert 宏
and we use the assert macro

357
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,366
确保这是真的
to make sure that's true

358
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,833
并且所有其他测试都以类似的方式工作
and all the other tests work in a similar way

359
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,133
这里真的没有什么新鲜事
there's really nothing new here

360
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:07,600
如果只是一行
if it's just one line

361
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,733
像这样的回应
of a response like this

362
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,466
不是从模板生成的
that wasn't generated from a template

363
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,233
那么我只是在那个响应上使用断言
well then I just use assert on that response

364
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,400
但如果是模板生成的代码
but if it's template generated code

365
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,033
我使用这种去除空白的模式
I use this pattern of removing white space

366
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,066
但你可以看看这里，你会看到
but you can look through here and you'll see that

367
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,233
他们都遵循相似的风格
all of them follow the similar style

368
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,700
更好的是他们都应该通过
and better yet they should all pass

369
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,966
他们确实做到了
and indeed they do

370
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,966
但如果你滚动
but if you scroll

371
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:29,166
向上
up

372
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,733
你可能想知道这里的所有这些输出是怎么回事
you might wonder what's with all this output up here

373
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,400
好吧，如果你记得
well if you recall

374
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:37,566
我们在处理程序顶部的管道有插件
our pipeline at the top of handler has plugins

375
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,400
记录和跟踪请求
to log and track requests

376
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,766
这些功能在插件模块中
those functions are in the plugins module

377
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:46,433
他们使用 io 打印出警告信息
and they use io to print out a warning message

378
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,500
并将信息记录到控制台
and log information to the console

379
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:49,866
但也许我们
but perhaps we

380
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:50,933
只想打印这个
only want to print this

381
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,533
应用程序时的东西到控制台
stuff to the console when the app

382
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,700
在特定环境中运行
is running in a specific environment

383
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,033
是的 mix 实际上支持三种不同的环境
yeah mix actually supports three different environments

384
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:01,066
dev test 和 prod 是 production 的缩写
dev test and prod which is short for production

385
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,333
de 是默认值，当我们使用时它会切换到测试
de is the default and it switches to test when we use

386
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,433
混合测试
mix test

387
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,200
所以假设我们只想看到这个的输出
so suppose we only want to see the output of this

388
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,066
开发过程中的日志功能
log function during development

389
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,433
虽然我们可以改变这个
while we can change this around

390
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,433
并在此处将其更改为多行函数
and change it to a multiline function here

391
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,300
然后我们只希望这条线运行
and then we only want this line to run

392
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,600
在开发过程中
during development

393
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,433
所以我们可以在这里放一个 if 语句
so we can put an if statement around here

394
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,400
如果你可以打电话给 mix
if and you can call mix

395
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:26,333
end 将返回当前的混音环境
end that will return the current mix environment

396
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,900
如果它等于 dev
if it equals dev

397
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,700
我们会继续打印出来
we'll go ahead and print that out

398
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,400
否则它不会记住
otherwise it won't and remember

399
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,533
因为这个日志在管道中起作用
because this log functions in a pipeline

400
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,866
我们总是需要返回 con
we always need to return co n

401
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:38,466
哦
oh

402
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:41,000
我总是忘记在 if 结尾加上露水
and I always forget to add the dew at the end of an if

403
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
只是旧习惯
just old habit

404
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,033
这样就可以处理日志
so that takes care of log

405
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,100
这里的跟踪功能怎么样
what about this track function up here

406
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,733
好吧，假设我们要跟踪四人之四
well let's say we want to track four of fours

407
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,566
在开发和生产中
in development and in production

408
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,200
但不在测试中
but not in test

409
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,166
所以我们可以在这里做的是说
so what we can do here is say

410
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,800
如果混合结束不等于测试做
if mix end does not equal test do

411
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,533
把它放在那个 if 条件里面
put that inside of that if condition

412
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,233
然后确保总是返回 co 和 v
and then make sure to always return co and v

413
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,733
如果我们把它保存起来
if we save that away

414
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,733
并运行我们的测试，我们应该得到更清晰的输出
and run our test we should get a lot cleaner output

415
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,100
我们去吧
there we go

416
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,633
如果我们很好地运行我们所有的测试
and if we run all of our test well

417
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:16,866
我们确实应该全面绿色
we should have green across the board indeed we do
