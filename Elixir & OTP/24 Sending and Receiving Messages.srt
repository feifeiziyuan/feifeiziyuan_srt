1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,766
hey folks we're out on the refuge today

2
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:03,900
playing around with some fancy new technology

3
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:07,366
trail cams we're positioning three of these at

4
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:08,933
different areas around the refuge

5
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:10,500
then to keep an eye on things

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
we can get a snapshot image from each

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,933
camera by sending a request

8
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:14,833
to an api

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,766
we're back in the studio

10
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,933
and you can see that we've added a video cam

11
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,866
ex file here and as usual you'll find

12
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:24,266
this and other prepared files in the code bundle

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,533
in this file just to find a module called video cam

14
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,233
that simulates sending a request to an external api

15
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:33,766
then we can get a snapshot image from a video camera

16
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,833
so the functions called gets napshot

17
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,133
we give it a camera name

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,600
and

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,533
here you would put the actual code to send a request

20
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,666
to that external api

21
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,166
but we're not going to worry about that

22
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,300
we're just going to simulate

23
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,700
that it can be relatively slow

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,133
by sleeping for one second

25
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:48,266
and then it's going to return some response

26
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,866
and so we've got an example response

27
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:50,700
that would be returned

28
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,566
from that api

29
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,066
we just take the camera name

30
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,466
add a hyphen dashnapshot

31
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,466
jpeg

32
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,000
now we're just returning the file name of this napshot

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,166
but you can imagine that it would return a full

34
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,066
url to a file living on an image server somewhere

35
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,966
so if we call that function

36
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,533
I'll just pass in cam one

37
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
well it takes a second to get a response

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,533
and it just returns that file name

39
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,400
same for cam two

40
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,233
we just get a different file name after a second

41
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,466
and cam three

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,066
and in handler dx we already have a

43
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:30,000
snapshot's route that gets us three snapshots

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,066
yeah it calls that function three times

45
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,366
so we get back three

46
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,300
different file names

47
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,433
we then put those file names into a snapshots list

48
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,466
and then we inspect that list

49
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,966
and that makes up our response body

50
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,033
we won't worry about how the images would get

51
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:44,966
rendered on a page

52
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,400
just so we can stay on topic

53
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,933
and you'll notice we could call that

54
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,233
get snapshot function

55
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,633
from the video cam module

56
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,333
and that's because we have that aliased in

57
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,133
up here at the top

58
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,033
alias survey videocam

59
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,233
now let's spawn the server in its own

60
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,666
process so we can continue to use iex

61
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,833
and we learned how to do this in the previous module

62
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,333
in this case we'll call spawn with the named function

63
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,533
so it's going to be our module hp server

64
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,966
the function is going to be start

65
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,100
and then we give it a list of arguments

66
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,233
we're going to start it on port 4000 again

67
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,500
then over in a different terminal session

68
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,366
we can send a request to get the snapshots

69
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,266
it's just going to be a request

70
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,533
to local those 4000 slash snapshots

71
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,466
and we have to wait for the request

72
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,066
and it's going to take a full

73
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,266
3 seconds to get back the response which

74
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,333
is at the list of those file names

75
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,033
so it shouldn't be any surprise that it takes 3 seconds

76
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,900
because the route calls to get snapshot function

77
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,900
three times and we know that each api request

78
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:39,900
takes one second

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,000
ah but we know how to do this more efficiently with

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,366
processes as we saw iex runs in its own process

81
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,233
and while in iex we spawn our http server

82
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,966
so the server is running in its own process

83
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,266
then when we send a request to our server

84
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,366
safer bears

85
00:02:57,366 --> 00:03:00,600
it spawns another process to handle that request

86
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,566
and once it is send a response back to the client

87
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,200
that process exits

88
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,433
in the same way

89
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,533
our new requests for snapshot spawns yet another

90
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,533
process to handle that request

91
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,533
right now in that process we send three

92
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,533
api requests sequentially

93
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,666
and since each request takes one second

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,433
the process has to wait a full 3 seconds

95
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,400
before sending back a response

96
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,233
instead we can spawn each api request

97
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:29,000
in its own process so they run in parallel

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,433
so processes can spawn other processes

99
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,866
and that way the request handling process will

100
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,766
only take as long as the slowest api request

101
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,200
which in our case is just one second

102
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,033
in our route function

103
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:45,000
we know how to spawn an api request in its own process

104
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,300
so here's the function we'll just call spawn

105
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,200
give it anonymous function there

106
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:50,533
run that

107
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:53,133
get snapshot function inside of the anonymous function

108
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:54,900
and what's going to happen if

109
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,566
we do this

110
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,166
well let's copy it out and just try it in iux

111
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,500
so I'll paste it in

112
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,166
I need to change this to use

113
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,400
servy dot because we don't have the alias here

114
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,133
it return

115
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,133
and it creates a process and it's going to run

116
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,600
that get snapshot function in that process

117
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,666
but we just see the pid right here

118
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,700
that's what's returned by the spawn function

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,600
but we don't see the value that's returned by

120
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,266
the get snapshot function

121
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,800
that's going to be the file name

122
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,300
we just get the pid

123
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,400
because that's what's returned by the spawn function

124
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,733
so now back over in our handler file

125
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,566
this really isn't snapshot one

126
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
this is a pid so let's call it pid one

127
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:34,900
but now we've got a problem right

128
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:38,033
we've got a pid but what we really need is snapshots

129
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:41,400
we need to create a list of snapshots or file names

130
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,833
so we need some way to return

131
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,000
the file name that's returned by this

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,433
get snapshot function

133
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,600
to the process that spawned it

134
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:50,666
in this case

135
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,066
that process is the one that's running this

136
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,033
route function

137
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,733
so we have two processes and since

138
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,566
one process spawned the other

139
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,866
you can think of this process as the parent

140
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,700
and this process is the child

141
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:06,100
this process gets a file name from an external api

142
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,633
and then needs to send that file name to this process

143
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:10,866
but how can it do that

144
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,933
if the processes run concurrently and

145
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,133
don't share anything

146
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:17,033
well you can think of processes as being kind of like

147
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,533
people we're all doing things concurrently

148
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,133
and we often need to communicate asynchronously

149
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,133
allowing each person to carry on

150
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,300
uninterrupted with whatever they're doing

151
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,733
how do we do that

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,133
while we send each other

153
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:32,500
a synchronous messages such as emails and text

154
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,833
which end up in some kind of mailbox

155
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,466
likewise each process has a mailbox

156
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,700
it's created when the process is created

157
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,033
in our case we're

158
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,833
only concerned with messages sent to the

159
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,033
parent process

160
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,333
so we'll focus on its mailbox

161
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,400
each mailbox has an address

162
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
it's the pid of the process

163
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,233
to send an asynchronous message

164
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,800
to the process's mailbox

165
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,033
we call send with two arguments

166
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,733
the pit of the process to send the message to

167
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,066
the parent pid in this case and the message to send

168
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,833
messages can be any elixir term

169
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,400
for example we could just send the file name

170
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:08,933
but it's common to use a tuple

171
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,000
to tag the message with some identifier

172
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
an atom we've arbitrarily chosen to tag it as result

173
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,900
but it could be anything

174
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,866
sending a message puts that

175
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:20,066
message in the process's mailbox

176
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:23,033
not unlike how you decide when to check your mailbox

177
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,366
a process gets decide

178
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,300
when it wants to read its messages

179
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,300
when it's ready it calls receive with a block

180
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,000
inside the block we use patterns to match messages

181
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,233
when a message matches this pattern

182
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,766
the process acts upon it in this case

183
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,600
we simply want to extract the file name and return it

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,133
and because the receive

185
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,200
function returns the value of the last

186
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,066
expression in the matching claws

187
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,800
we can bind it to a variable

188
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,600
having matched this message

189
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,566
it's removed from the mailbox

190
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,633
now what we really want to do is spawn three

191
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:57,833
processes all at once so they run in parallel

192
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,600
each process will send the final

193
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,766
name it got from the external api

194
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
back to the same parent process

195
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,066
when the parent is ready

196
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,900
it reads the messages one by one

197
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
by calling receive three times

198
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,133
once for each message

199
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,066
in this way the parent process can collect

200
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,766
all the file names in a list

201
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,066
you'll often hear this

202
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,800
referred to as the actor model of concurrency

203
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,233
each process is an actor living in its own independent

204
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,600
isolated little world

205
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,433
it doesn't share anything with other processes

206
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:29,600
the only way processes can communicate

207
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,833
is by sending and receiving messages

208
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,033
let's give this a whirl in iex

209
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,666
we want to spawn a process and have it send a result

210
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,233
back to the parent process

211
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,900
so who's the parent process

212
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,233
well

213
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,733
we're going to do the spawning from this iex session

214
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,700
so it's the parent process you remember

215
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,766
you can get the pit of the current process by calling

216
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,333
self so the iex session process is pied to 48

217
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,866
and I'm going to sign that

218
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,600
pid to a variable call to parent

219
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,866
and I'll explain why in a minute now

220
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,466
we can spawn a process and use that pid

221
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:01,466
to send a message back to the iex process

222
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,766
and to do that we use the send function

223
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,566
we want to send it back to the parent

224
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,333
so we give it the parents pid

225
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,633
and then we give it the message

226
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,733
in this case our message is going to be a toople

227
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,133
but as the coal said you can use any elixir term

228
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,066
so we're going to use a toople

229
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,533
we're going to tag it with result

230
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,333
again that's just arbitrary you could use any tag there

231
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,266
and then we want to put in our actual file name

232
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:27,366
so I'm going to use one snapshot jpeg

233
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,200
in spawn returns immediately and gives us the pid

234
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,300
so the spawn process is pid two seventy eight

235
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
but that's all the output that we get

236
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,266
but we know that calling sind

237
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,900
is going to put this message

238
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:44,233
in the mailbox of the parent which is this pid

239
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,200
so let's just take a peaky peak at that mailbox

240
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:50,300
and we can do that by calling the process modules

241
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,400
info function

242
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,100
and this just lets us query

243
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,833
different attributes of a process

244
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,766
so we want to look at the parent process

245
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,533
and we want to see what messages are in your mailbox

246
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,433
and we see that there's one message it's right here

247
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,900
now you notice it converted into a keyword list

248
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,300
we used a two pole right like that

249
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,366
but it just displayed it as a keyword list

250
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,766
in any event the mailbox has one message

251
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,966
now when you use process info this way

252
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:16,600
it just shows us what's in the mailbox

253
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,133
it doesn't actually take out any of the messages

254
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:22,233
at this point the spawn process is long gone

255
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,733
its only job was to send a message back to the parent

256
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,900
then it exited

257
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,600
and we can let the message sit in the mailbox

258
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,866
until we're ready to do something

259
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,633
with it messages will remain in the mailbox

260
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,700
until they're explicitly received

261
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,700
or the process the parent in this case terminates

262
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,166
now let's say we're ready to receive the message

263
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
and to do that we call receive and we give it a block

264
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,200
and I'm just going to have multiple lines here in iux

265
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm just going to hit return

266
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,066
and then inside of that block

267
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,166
we need a pattern that

268
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,666
matches the message in the mailbox

269
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,466
so it's a tuple

270
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,833
has the atom result

271
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,400
then it has a file name and we want to bind that

272
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,033
to a variable

273
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,233
I'm going to call it file name

274
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,866
and when the message matches that pattern

275
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,200
we want to return the extracted file name

276
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:04,733
so we just do that

277
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,733
and then we'll just in the block

278
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,633
and we see the result is one snapshot jpeg

279
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,200
so when we call receive it

280
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
examine the message in the mailbox

281
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
it match this pattern

282
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,100
so this becomes the result of the receive function here

283
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,800
and that's why we see the value one snapshot jpeg in ix

284
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,366
once we've received the message

285
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,700
it's removed from the mailbox

286
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,200
so if we try this again

287
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,666
the mailbox should be empty and sure enough it is

288
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,533
let's in another message with a different file name

289
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,100
I'm going to call it two snapshot

290
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,733
and then I'm going to receive it on one line

291
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,700
so the pattern is result

292
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,566
capture the file name

293
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,333
return the file name end

294
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,433
and it match that message to snapshot

295
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,766
and now the mailbox is empty again

296
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,766
so what would happen if we call receive

297
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,933
before a message actually arrives in the mailbox

298
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:58,833
well to set that up

299
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,666
we'll have this bond process sleep for 15 seconds

300
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,133
before sending the result

301
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,600
so I'll change this to three snapshot just to make it

302
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,233
different

303
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,766
and then before we do the sin I'm going to use timer

304
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,566
sleep 15 seconds

305
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,600
and just put us in my colon

306
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,266
so we have two expressions there

307
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:15,966
we're going to sleep

308
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,166
and then we're going to do the send

309
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,133
now let's immediately peek in the mailbox

310
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,000
well it's still empty and now let's call receive

311
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,333
well it looks like it's just hanging there

312
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,833
and it's hanging because receive is a blocking call

313
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,166
it's waiting for a message to arrive in the mailbox

314
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,700
if you call receive

315
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,633
and the mailbox doesn't contain any matching messages

316
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,500
then the current process which is ix in this case

317
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,300
suspends until a matching message arrives

318
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:46,433
and then finally after 15 seconds we get the message

319
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,333
receive is patient though

320
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:50,133
it would have waited indefinitely

321
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,233
now what happens if we spawn three processes that each

322
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,300
send a message to the parent's mailbox

323
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,100
first we'll send snapshot two

324
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,433
then we'll send snapshot one

325
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,133
then we'll send snapshot three

326
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,533
and then we'll have a look in the mailbox

327
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,433
well now we have a list of messages in the mailbox

328
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:07,566
and they're ordered in the same

329
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:08,833
order in which we sent them

330
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,766
we sent snapshot two first

331
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,000
then snapshot one then snapshot three

332
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,466
so that gives us a snapshot two

333
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,166
and it's removed from their mailbox

334
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,066
snapshot one and then snapshot three

335
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,266
now notice the messages are received in the same

336
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,566
order they arrived in the mailbox

337
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,166
in other words it's first in first out

338
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,766
or first in first received

339
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:33,100
in the mailboxes once again empty

340
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,766
okay so when we started

341
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:37,500
why did we assign the parents pid to a variable

342
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,366
and then we sent a message to that parent

343
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,533
so why can we have just use self right here

344
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,866
we see that it spawns a process

345
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,033
so if parent and self are the same thing

346
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,533
then the message should be in the parent's mailbox

347
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,733
hmm but the parent's mailbox is empty

348
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,766
well it turns out this is a really common mistake

349
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,433
remember that

350
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,733
self returns the pid of the current process

351
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,533
so when we call self up here

352
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,000
the current process is this iexcession process

353
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,233
and it returns the pid of that process

354
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,466
but calling self inside of

355
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,400
this spawn function right here

356
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,533
is going to return the pid

357
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,733
of that spawn process

358
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,600
so parent and self aren't the same thing

359
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,566
when this spawn process runs

360
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,133
it's important to keep in mind that the pid return by

361
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:30,133
self changes depending on where it's called

362
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,700
when it's called here

363
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,666
it's going to be the iexcession process

364
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,600
when it's called here

365
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,766
it's going to be the process that's being spawned

366
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,333
that's why we had to save the value of self

367
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,100
before spawning the process

368
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,933
because self's going to change

369
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,000
but parent won't change because we've saved it off

370
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,566
if we send to self

371
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:51,166
then the message is put in the mailbox of the spawn

372
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,866
process but then that mailbox gets destroyed

373
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,800
when the spawn process exits

374
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,866
so unless you really want to send a message

375
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,933
back to yourself

376
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,500
you typically won't call

377
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,833
self inside of a spawn function

378
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,933
to send a message

379
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,733
instead you'll have a variable something like a parent

380
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,000
that you're going to send the message back to

381
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,200
now we know how to solve our original problem

382
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,100
yeah when we spawn this process

383
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,633
we need to send a message

384
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,266
back to the parent process

385
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,600
which is the process

386
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,700
that called this route function in the first place

387
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,900
and that message is going to include the result of

388
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
calling get snapshot

389
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,966
now let's just focus on the first api request

390
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:34,700
so we can actually comment out these other two cameras

391
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,000
and we want to send a message back to

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,133
the parent process so the first thing we need to do

393
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,166
is save off that parent process

394
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,266
we'll save the parent equals self

395
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,066
and in this context this is the

396
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,666
request handling process

397
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,900
that's the process we spawn in http server

398
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:54,466
that runs the route function

399
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:57,433
now you might see this referred to as the caller

400
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,433
since it's the pid

401
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,666
of the process that called this function

402
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,766
but to stay consistent we'll keep the name parent

403
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,166
then when we spawn this process

404
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,700
we want to send a message back to that

405
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,533
so we will send

406
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,633
to the parent

407
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,566
the result of calling this function

408
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,900
but we're going to wrap it into tuple

409
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,000
so it's going to be result

410
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,433
and then the second

411
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,000
element in that tuple is going to be

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,733
the result of calling gets napshot

413
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,100
and we don't need this pid

414
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,700
so I'm just going to get rid of this on the front

415
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,033
then once we spawn that process

416
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,800
we'll immediately call receive

417
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,600
and wait for the message to arrive

418
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,633
so we'll say snapshot one

419
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,966
equals receive

420
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,766
we'll put in that pattern

421
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,100
return the extracted file name

422
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,700
just like we did before

423
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,366
now it's important to note that this receive

424
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:46,666
is getting called in the parent process

425
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,200
because in the parent we want to wait

426
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,500
for the message to arrive

427
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,466
from that spawned process

428
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,900
and because we only expect one kind of message

429
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,266
we just need to pattern match on that message

430
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,433
now processes can send and receive multiple

431
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:01,000
different kinds of messages

432
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:01,733
as such

433
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:05,266
receive can match messages against multiple patterns

434
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,066
similar to how a case expression works

435
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,466
with multiple clauses

436
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,000
we'll actually see an example of that

437
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,233
in the later section

438
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,900
for now though we just need one pattern

439
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,500
then once we get that final even snapshot one

440
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
we just need to remember to return

441
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,200
snapshot one here

442
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,433
because we don't yet have a list of snapshots

443
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,300
we just have one

444
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,833
so if we save that away

445
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,600
now we're going to need to restart our server

446
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,333
so I'm just going to restart ix

447
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,566
then we'll spawn our server

448
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:34,566
then we'll send a request for snapshots

449
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,100
and it should return a file name

450
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:37,533
and indeed it does

451
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,633
and that's pretty cool

452
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,266
this is a great start

453
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,933
now we just need to do the same

454
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,666
thing for the other two cameras

455
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,533
so let's go ahead and duplicate the code

456
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,500
because it demonstrates something interesting

457
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,833
now don't worry we'll clean this up later

458
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,700
I'm just going to copy these two lines

459
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,600
we'll get rid of this comment here

460
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,466
I'm just going to paste in what I copied

461
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,800
so this is going to be for cam two

462
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,400
and then we'll get snapshot two

463
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:03,866
I'll paste it again

464
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
this is going to be for cam three

465
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,766
and we'll get snapshot three

466
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
then we can uncomment this list

467
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,300
so we put snapshot one

468
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,133
two and three in a list

469
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,633
and then we just need to return

470
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,466
that list so we'll call inspect on

471
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,633
snapshots now

472
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,133
so save that away

473
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:26,733
we'll restart our server again

474
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:30,866
and what could go wrong

475
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,266
let's go ahead and send the request

476
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,733
whoa it still takes 3 seconds

477
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,200
why well because remember that receive blocks

478
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
right we send one request

479
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,133
and then wait for the result calling receive

480
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,200
before sending the next request

481
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:51,566
so even though each

482
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
process runs concurrently

483
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,566
our code is effectively serialized

484
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,300
now this is fairly obvious because of the duplication

485
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:01,166
but it serves as a warning to be mindful of blocking

486
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,500
calls that become synchronization points in your code

487
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,166
and receive is one of those blocking calls

488
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,633
to fix this problem

489
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,600
all we need to do is rearrange the code

490
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,533
so that we spawn the process as first

491
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,566
then receive all the messages

492
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,733
so I'll take this bond and move it up here

493
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,100
same with this bond

494
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,366
and then we'll do all the receives after that

495
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,533
so now

496
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:26,800
all the processes are going to get spawned at once

497
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,366
this is going to happen really fast

498
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,333
and then we wait for the three messages

499
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,033
the fastest api request

500
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,400
is going to send a message first

501
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,633
so it's going to be the first one in the mailbox

502
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,000
and then the next fastest

503
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,633
and then finally the slowest one

504
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:40,866
but overall

505
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,133
since the processes are running concurrently

506
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:44,633
we only have to wait as long

507
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:46,233
as the slowest api request

508
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,233
which in our case is just one second

509
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,133
so now if we save this away

510
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
restart the server again

511
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,533
and now let's try that request one final time

512
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:59,666
and we get all three snapshots in just one second

513
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,500
each of the processes are running in parallel

514
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,066
which is really sweet

515
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,433
to coordinate a synchronous work

516
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,566
all we had to do was spawn

517
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,000
sand and receive

518
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,100
now it's worth recognizing that this

519
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:16,266
only works because the individual api requests

520
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,766
don't depend on each other

521
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,033
and when you have independent chunks of work like this

522
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,433
that you can run in parallel

523
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,600
will buy all means

524
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,266
take full advantage of the power

525
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:26,033
of elixir's concurrency model

526
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,133
in the next section

527
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,200
we'll remove the duplication we see here

528
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,633
and discover an abstraction for running

529
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,666
any task asynchronously
