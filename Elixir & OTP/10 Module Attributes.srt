1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,600
in the last module we handled an about page

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,600
and I can imagine having routes for other static pages

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,066
maybe a contact page or an f page

4
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:09,866
yeah and to serve each of those pages

5
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:10,300
we'd first

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,233
need to get the absolute path to the pages directory

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,733
as we did with the about page

8
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,033
so to share this bit of code

9
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:19,433
we could extract it into a function

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,366
but the path to the pages directory is a constant

11
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,366
which gives us an opportunity to learn something

12
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:25,633
new about modules

13
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,833
modules can have attributes

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,900
module attributes are defined at the

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,300
top level of a module

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,000
and in general

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,733
you can use module attributes to associate metadata

18
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,733
with the module

19
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,333
for example elixir has

20
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,400
two reserved module attributes

21
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,633
for documenting modules and functions

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,133
the documentation for a module goes at the

23
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,266
top of the module

24
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,466
and the name of the module attribute is module dock

25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,766
and you notice it starts with an at sign

26
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:54,033
that indicates that it's a module attribute

27
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,700
and then because it's documentation

28
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,766
we can give it a string

29
00:00:56,766 --> 00:01:00,666
so say handles http requests

30
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:01,700
now you can use it here

31
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,066
doc

32
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,500
and add a bunch more documentation here in the string

33
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,733
but I'm going to just keep it really

34
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,166
simple for this screencast

35
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,566
because you really don't want to watch me

36
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:09,966
typing in documentation

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,033
so that documents the module

38
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:15,033
there's also a module attribute called at doc

39
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,866
that document the function underneath it

40
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,700
so this one might be transforms

41
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,700
the request

42
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,033
into a response

43
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,500
and the same attribute can be set

44
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,033
multiple times in a module

45
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:29,800
so to document this function

46
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,233
we would also use the

47
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,333
dock module attribute and then the string might be

48
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,233
logs four or four requests

49
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:39,400
and then using these well defined attributes

50
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,200
elixir can access the values to generate documentation

51
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,466
so elixir has

52
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:47,633
reserved attributes for documentation purposes

53
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,600
and we can add

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,000
arbitrary or custom module attributes as well

55
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,266
yeah another common use of module attributes is as

56
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,666
constants and that's exactly what we have

57
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:58,533
down here

58
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,000
we can take this and make it a consonant

59
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,733
so I'm just going to copy it and the module attribute

60
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,000
it just has to be defined at the top level of module

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,566
but you can put it anywhere

62
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:11,066
and so we can call this one pages path

63
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,533
and then the value will be

64
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,066
the result of that expression

65
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,466
then down in our pipeline

66
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,400
instead of doing this

67
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:19,133
we can just read that value at pages path

68
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,333
and if we had

69
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,933
other route functions that needed to read page files

70
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:25,100
while they could use the pages path attribute

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,966
what's also nice

72
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,533
is that using a constant lets us easily change

73
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,800
the location of the page

74
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,100
directory in one place

75
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,933
so if we run it now we see that it works

76
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,400
now I said that you can add module attributes

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
anywhere in the top level of module

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,666
but I generally put constants at the top of a module

79
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,100
because their value is set at compile time

80
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:45,933
so I'm going to take this out of here

81
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,666
and we'll just put it right up here

82
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,866
under the module dock

83
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:50,733
just like that

84
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:54,100
so now any function defined below this point

85
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,400
can read the value
