1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,000
in the last section we assume that we

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,666
always get post parameters in the same format

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,666
but that's not always the case

4
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,666
let's have a look at this post request

5
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:09,066
again

6
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:12,366
in the last section we hinted that this content type

7
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,300
was kind of important

8
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,000
when the content type is set to this value

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,633
it means that the body is a query string

10
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,600
encoded in this name

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,866
value pair format that we see down here

12
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:26,466
so the content type effectively tells us how to parse

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,700
the request body

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
now you can also post data encoded differently

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,133
so it's important to check the content type

16
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,900
to determine how to parse the body

17
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,966
to do that we need to parse all of these headers

18
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:38,600
and we

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,433
already have them right now as a list of strings

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,933
so we've added a bit of logging so that we can see that

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,033
so here is our headers as a list of strings

22
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,333
but transforming this into a map with key value pairs

23
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,566
well that would be so much more useful

24
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,866
so to set this up over in our co and v struck

25
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,333
similar to how we have para as a field

26
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,700
and it has a default value of empty map

27
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,166
what we want to do the same thing with headers

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,233
so we'll have a headers field

29
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,566
and it'll also default to an empty map

30
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,466
and then over in the parse function similar to prams

31
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,000
we need to parse our headers

32
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,000
so we'll have headers equals

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,466
and we're going to write a function called

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,566
parse headers

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,100
and it's going to pass in

36
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,966
header lines which remember is a list of strings

37
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,100
then once we have those

38
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,333
parsed down when we initialize our co and v struck

39
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,366
while we want to set that field headers

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,200
to be the value of that header's variable

41
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,700
so of course we need to define this function

42
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,666
and I'll just do this

43
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:36,533
right down here

44
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,300
takes in the headers lines

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,500
and ultimately this is going to need to return a

46
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,000
map of the headers

47
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:46,500
so how are we going to do that

48
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,266
well let's look at that request again

49
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,700
so the conventional way to do this would be to

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,266
loop through these header lines

51
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,300
which is a list

52
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,966
pars each line into a key value pair

53
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:56,633
so for example

54
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,766
this line the key would be host and the value would be

55
00:01:58,933 --> 00:01:59,933
example com

56
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,966
and then accumulate those key value pairs

57
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,066
in the headers map

58
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,433
but here's the thing though

59
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,466
there are no conventional looping constructs in elixir

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,266
but remember in the last section when we saw that

61
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,766
list our recursive data structures

62
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,200
I've recreated our sex session from the prior video

63
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,266
and we started with a list of numbs

64
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,600
and remember that we used the head and tail

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,733
pattern match with that cons operator

66
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:25,700
to traverse through this list

67
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:28,433
so the first time the head had a value of one

68
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,633
and then tail was a list itself

69
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,233
and then we use tail on the right hand side

70
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,033
and then the value of head was two

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
and tail was three four and five

72
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:41,400
and so on all the way down to the point where tail

73
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,533
was a one element list

74
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,866
we then matched it against that pattern

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,300
and head was the element five

76
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,300
but tail was an empty list

77
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,300
so by pattern matching tail each time

78
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,833
we recursively walked through each element of the list

79
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
here's a simple program that does the same thing

80
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,833
it's in a standalone file called recurred

81
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,033
ex it's not in a mixed project

82
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:05,900
and you can find

83
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
it in the code bundle if you want to follow along

84
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,433
so it just defines a module called recurse

85
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,600
it has a function called loopy

86
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,633
and then we call loopy down here and we pass it a

87
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,700
list of numbers one through five

88
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,466
that matches the pattern

89
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,800
that's the argument in this loopy function

90
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,800
which gives us the head and the tail

91
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,933
we print out the head print out the tail

92
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,433
and then here's the key part

93
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,066
we call loopy on itself here

94
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:33,466
passing in the tail which is that remaining list

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,700
in other words it's recursive and if we run it

96
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,500
well we get the same output

97
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,666
we got in ix just in a little bit

98
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,333
different format

99
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,366
so you see that it's just

100
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,866
walking through the list recursively

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
pulling off the head and the tail

102
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,666
until finally we get

103
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,900
to the point where the tail is an empty list

104
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,933
but what about this function clause air

105
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,933
well remember

106
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,466
the tail of the final element of any list is

107
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,200
always an empty list

108
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,966
so when it loops with tail being an empty list

109
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,966
the pattern doesn't match

110
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:04,733
yeah

111
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,466
so we need a function clause that matches that pattern

112
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,733
which will effectively terminate the recursion

113
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,066
I'm just going to paste one in

114
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,300
so it's loopy

115
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,233
with an empty list

116
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,833
and when this function is called

117
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,800
because that pattern matches while we know the worth

118
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,633
the end so we just print out done

119
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:20,933
say that away

120
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,800
run it again well sure enough it prints out done

121
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,733
when we've walked through the entire list

122
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,000
so there are three ingredients that make this work

123
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,933
the first one is these multi claws functions

124
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,200
this is called the terminating claws here

125
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,700
the second is we do pattern matching on

126
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,066
the head and the tail

127
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,733
this is the pattern up until the list is empty

128
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,833
and then we match on the empty list

129
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:42,800
to know that we're done

130
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,866
and the final ingredient of course is recursion

131
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,600
we're looping back on ourself

132
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,866
so to loop through the header lines we can recurs

133
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,533
the same way with two function clauses

134
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,533
that's going to happen over in our parser

135
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,033
and right now our parsed headers function

136
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,066
takes one argument these header lines

137
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,066
but we're going to change this

138
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,333
around to match a pattern

139
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,266
it's going to be

140
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,033
head and tail

141
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,400
and then just like with the recursive numbers we need

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,100
to call the parse headers function as the last

143
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,466
line of this function here

144
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,733
and we're going to pass in the tail

145
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,800
remember just like we did an ix and that program

146
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:18,466
we keep

147
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,900
matching on the tail until we get to the end of it

148
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,233
and then above this line

149
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,866
I'm just going to add a little bit of debug

150
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,200
just so we can see what's going on

151
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,133
and I'm using the inspect function on these lists

152
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:33,400
just

153
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,900
because it'll print out the raw form of these lists

154
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,833
and then we also have these labels head and tail

155
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,633
around it

156
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,366
we also need a second function clause when our

157
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,866
list returns empty

158
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,833
yeah it's just parse headers

159
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,700
it's going to be the empty list

160
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,966
and in this case we'll print out

161
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,533
done just like we did before

162
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,466
so now if we save that away

163
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,466
and we recompile

164
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:58,066
we scroll back up just to see what that debug gave us

165
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,600
well the first time through the head is

166
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,833
this host line and the tail is all the remaining lines

167
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:05,900
then the second time through

168
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,933
it's the second thing in the list

169
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,600
and the tail is everything else

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,866
and it just walks through until finally

171
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,633
the head is the last line content length

172
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,666
and the tail is an empty list

173
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,866
and it matches the empty list and we get back done

174
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,900
so the next question is

175
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,100
what do we want to do for each head and tail

176
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,333
well we really don't

177
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,600
care about the tail

178
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,066
but for each head

179
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,966
we want to parse it into a key value pair

180
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,100
and we know how to parse a string

181
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,166
and match the returned list

182
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,733
yeah I'll just do it down below this debugging

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,366
just give it a little bit of space here

184
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,766
our pattern is going to be a key in a value

185
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,800
and we'll take string split

186
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,733
split the head

187
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,366
and the dilemma here is a colon and a space

188
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:51,500
and then I want to add a little bit more logging

189
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,766
so I'm just going to copy this

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,500
and we'll do it

191
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,966
after we have the key in the value

192
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,066
I'm just going to change these around

193
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,033
this will be our key

194
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,800
and this will be our value

195
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,533
now if we save that away

196
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,000
come back over here and recon pilot again

197
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,200
and scroll up here

198
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,466
all right head host example

199
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,533
com and notice we have key

200
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,900
well the key is host and the value is example

201
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,166
com similarly when we have the head being this

202
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,300
user agent line

203
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:21,966
while the key is user agent

204
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,100
and the value is

205
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,033
whatever the value of that in the header is

206
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:29,266
so we're successfully parsing this string the head

207
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,433
into key value pairs

208
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,700
so the next thing we want to do is put

209
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,400
the key value pairs in the header's map

210
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,633
so I'll do that right below this line

211
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,733
we'll have variable headers like I did before

212
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,000
I took it out a little bit earlier

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,366
but we'll put it back in here

214
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,233
and then we want to make a map

215
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,333
so we're going to use the map modules put function

216
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,933
we're going to start off with an empty map

217
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,100
and then we'll add the key and the value to that map

218
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,500
and just to give a little bit more debug

219
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,800
we'll do io inspect

220
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,066
on those headers

221
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,633
so let's run it again

222
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,833
so here's the head and tail output

223
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,800
here are our key value pairs and then we have a map

224
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,766
host is the key example

225
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:10,733
com as the value

226
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,233
if we look down at this one here's our head and tail

227
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:14,866
here's the key value

228
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,633
and then we have a map with user agent as the key

229
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:19,233
but it's a new map

230
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,466
every time yeah this one has one key value

231
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,000
this one has one key value

232
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
if we keep looking through here

233
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,533
it's always one key in value

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,533
we need a way to remember the header's map and add

235
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,700
to it each time through the loop

236
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,833
because we want all the header information

237
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,266
to end up in a single map

238
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
in other words we need a way to maintain state

239
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:41,000
and there's only one way to do that

240
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,533
and that's to take the state

241
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,000
a map in our case

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,700
and pass it as an argument to the recursive function

243
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,166
before we do that

244
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,433
let's get rid of this debugging just to clean this up

245
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,566
so we can see what's going on

246
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:53,933
then we're going to change

247
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,866
the function claws to take a second argument

248
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,200
and we're going to call it headers

249
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,133
and then instead of calling map

250
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:03,766
put passing in an empty map as the first argument here

251
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,800
we want to pass in headers

252
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,366
because we want to add the key and the value

253
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,200
to this header's map

254
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,900
then here's the key part

255
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,300
when we recursively call parse headers

256
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:18,066
we need to pass in headers as that 2nd argument

257
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,533
likewise we need to change our termination claws to

258
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:22,433
also take headers

259
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,666
now when this termination claws runs

260
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,400
it means worth the end of the list

261
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,066
so instead of printing out done

262
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,800
we just want to return that headers map

263
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,266
and it should have all the key value pairs in it

264
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:34,666
now don't forget

265
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,733
we need to update the function call

266
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,233
to pass in an empty map

267
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,600
as the second argument

268
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,666
so we start out with an empty map

269
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,066
yeah it's this call right here

270
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,800
it's just passing in header lines

271
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,033
but we know we have to take two arguments

272
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,933
so we're just going to start this off with

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,033
an empty map

274
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,000
so just to walk through this we call parts headers

275
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:55,766
passing in an empty map that comes down here

276
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,233
matches head and tail

277
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,233
and then

278
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,566
we go through there accumulating

279
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
all the keys and values into this header's map

280
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,666
passing it back to itself

281
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,600
until finally Bing

282
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:10,333
we get the final header map returned from parse headers

283
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,966
so now if we save this away

284
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,166
come back over and recompile

285
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:15,500
we'll check it out

286
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,033
here's our co and v structure and it has a headers

287
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:21,400
field and the value of that field is a map

288
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,000
containing all of our headers

289
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:24,100
now

290
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,833
if you've done recursion like this in other languages

291
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,300
you might be concerned that recurring this way

292
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,466
with a large enough list could consume a lot of memory

293
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,033
and blow up the call stack

294
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,566
but because the last

295
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,033
thing the function does is call itself

296
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:41,333
elixir uses something called tail call optimization

297
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,266
no new frames are pushed onto the call stack

298
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,866
so it consumes no additional memory

299
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
in other words this is really efficient in elixir

300
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,400
so now that we've collected all the headers

301
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,933
we can return to our original problem

302
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,266
if the content type matches this

303
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,033
then we can proceed with the parsing we

304
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,100
already have in parse parts

305
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,733
but if not then we'll ignore

306
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,200
the request body or the param string altogether

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,233
and to do that

308
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:10,900
we're going to use

309
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,166
multi claws functions in pattern matching

310
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,100
so what we'll do is we'll change

311
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,033
this function to

312
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:18,633
take the content type as the first argument

313
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,466
and that way we can pattern match on it

314
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:25,033
and then when we call parsh para which happens up here

315
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,166
well we'll pass it the value that's in the headers map

316
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,533
associated with the key

317
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,133
content type

318
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,900
so if the content type is this application

319
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,200
x wow form url encoded

320
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,966
well we want to decode it

321
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:45,500
using that I code query function

322
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,366
but we also need to define a

323
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:50,333
default clause for all other content types

324
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,700
so it's going to be called pars para

325
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,100
and we don't really care what the content type is

326
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,300
and we don't even care about the param string

327
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,533
because if we fall through to this level

328
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,233
well we're just going to return an empty map

329
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:05,900
because we're going to match this one

330
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,433
and we're going to handle it the way we know how

331
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,366
by decoding it

332
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,766
but for everything else

333
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,300
well we don't know how to deal with that

334
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,133
so we're just going to return an empty map

335
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,533
now if we save this away it should run just as it did

336
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,333
before

337
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,566
and indeed it does

338
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,933
but let's change the content type of our post request

339
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,833
let's make it a multi part slash form data

340
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,300
if we run it now

341
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,833
we see that the para is empty just as expected

342
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:32,733
yeah

343
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,133
this is another content type that web servers handle

344
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,866
but it's a lot more complicated and

345
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,266
there's really nothing new to teach about

346
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,766
elixir by implementing that

347
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,666
plus it probably takes a long time to do

348
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,033
so I'm just going to set it back

349
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,633
and say that we just handle this content type

350
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,766
recursion is a basic building block of elixir

351
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,866
and you'll see it used extensively

352
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,766
but you won't often use it to

353
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,266
traverse and process the list as we did

354
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,566
yeah this kind of code is so common

355
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:01,900
that the e new module provides convenience functions

356
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,400
for manipulating lists

357
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,200
providing a really nice abstraction from the details

358
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
but under the hood the e new functions are implemented

359
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,266
using recursion

360
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,166
we'll have a look at the e new module coming up next
