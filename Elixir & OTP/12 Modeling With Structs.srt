1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,633
we're currently using a map

2
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:03,200
to represent our conversation

3
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,300
and maps are a generic data structure

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,966
we can add arbitrary keys and values to maps

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,133
but our conversation has some implied constraints

6
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:14,133
it has a fixed set of fields with default values

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,900
and since it's the central data structure of our app

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,333
it flows through the entire pipeline

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,300
we'd like to give it a bit more structure

10
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:23,566
and that's exactly what a structure gives us

11
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:25,966
now a structure needs to live in its own

12
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,433
module and we'll put it in its own file too

13
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:31,033
under lib survey will create a new file

14
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,766
and we'll call it con

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,933
ex

16
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,566
and then inside of that we'll define our co n module

17
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,233
service nv

18
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,600
then to define a structure within that module we use

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,933
def structure

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,766
and we pass it a keyword list it looks like this

21
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,300
square brackets

22
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,333
and then inside of there

23
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,733
we list the fields of this structure

24
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,300
so one of them is method

25
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:55,633
that's the name of the field

26
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,200
and then we can give it default values

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,766
this one's just going to be an empty string

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,700
same way with path

29
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,733
response body is also empty

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,333
and then we have a status field

31
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,100
and we'll default that to nil

32
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,566
keyword lister

33
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:12,433
commonly used to pass options to a function

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,900
or in this case an elixir macro

35
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,366
since the keyword list is the last

36
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,966
and only argument

37
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,300
we can actually remove the square brackets

38
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,500
so what's the name of this structure

39
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,666
well it's the same as the name of the module servey

40
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:30,066
co and v that's why a structure must live in a module

41
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,266
and you can't define

42
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,500
more than one struck

43
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,300
per module so let's save that

44
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,000
away and we'll fire up an ix session

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,700
just to get a feel

46
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,100
for how the s works

47
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,466
I'm inside of the top level survey directory

48
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,333
and I'm going to use fix

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,033
s mix so that we're running this as a mix application

50
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,633
and you notice it interpreted that

51
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,066
code that was outside of the module

52
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:49,233
so

53
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,166
I'm just going to clean this up and go back to the top

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,366
so you probably remember how we create a map

55
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:56,333
we just use per cent and then curly braces like that

56
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,466
well similarly we can create a structure

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,233
by using % curly braces

58
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:02,500
but

59
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,333
between the two of them we put the name of the struck

60
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,166
so it's servey co n

61
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,533
and we notice the result is a strict

62
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,200
it's got these

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,300
fixed fields inside of it with their default values

64
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,800
now we can also create the structure and supply

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,266
values to override those defaults

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,766
so if we wanted to override method

67
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:19,900
we would just say method

68
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:20,733
would be get

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,833
and maybe the path would be slash bears for example

70
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:26,933
and you notice the method is now get

71
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,033
and the path is bears

72
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,800
and then we have the default values

73
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,300
for the remaining fields

74
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,333
now unlike a map we can't create a structure with

75
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,433
a field that's not in the keyword list like

76
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,733
name is mike

77
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,066
now you'd probably

78
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,133
never just add a spurious field like this

79
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,233
but if you're like me

80
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,700
then you're likely to miss type of field

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,900
like maybe you forget the o and method

82
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,500
yeah what's nice here is

83
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,766
the constraint is checked at compile time

84
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,266
so misspelled field names won't slip through

85
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,733
for example now let's get rid of all this red

86
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,533
and we'll just go back to the version

87
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,933
that had this spelled right

88
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,700
and we can access fields of the structure

89
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,333
just like accessing a map

90
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:06,900
using dot notation

91
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,266
so if we want to look at the method

92
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
or we want to look at the path

93
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,700
well it's the familiar dot notation

94
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,733
we're used to with a map

95
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:16,466
but unlike maps the square bracket syntax won't work

96
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,733
so we try to do this

97
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,200
well we get an error message

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
so you can say that structures have stricter access

99
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,533
since they don't allow dynamic access

100
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,633
using square brackets like maps do

101
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,700
for example we still have our map loaded up in ix here

102
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,633
and if I would try to access

103
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,000
the age key of that map

104
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:36,866
well it just returns nil

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,300
but if we try to do the same

106
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,266
thing with our co and v struck

107
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,633
well we get an actual error rather than returning nil

108
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,100
so again with a struck we get compile time checking

109
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,800
which often saves your bacon

110
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,300
now updating a structure is similar to updating a map

111
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,166
for example

112
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,566
let's say we wanted to update the status code to 200

113
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,366
we'll use this familiar syntax we say co and v

114
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:01,966
a vertical bar and then status of 200

115
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,500
then we see the status has been updated

116
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,700
it follows then that we can also pattern match struts

117
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,433
so I have my co and v struck on the

118
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:11,333
right hand side

119
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,266
and I want to write a pattern on the left hand

120
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,300
side that matches it

121
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,900
well it would be servey

122
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:19,833
co and v and if I just use method as get

123
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,933
looks like that

124
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,833
well that'll match because this is a co n struck

125
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,533
and it certainly has a

126
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,100
field method with a value of get

127
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,500
and we don't care what else is in there

128
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,433
because remember on the left hand side

129
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,300
we don't have to give all the fields to get a match

130
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,300
in the same way we could match it against a status

131
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,133
of 200 for example

132
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,066
and no surprise

133
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,800
we can also extract values in the pattern match

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,966
as we've already learned

135
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,533
yeah I'll just use the variable method right there

136
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:53,700
and that's a match

137
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,166
and if we look at method well it's bound to the string

138
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,400
get so using a structure feels a lot like using a map

139
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,333
and in fact a strict instance

140
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,466
is just a special kind of map

141
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,533
with a thick set of keys and default values

142
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,633
and we can kind of test that there's a function in

143
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,233
elixir called is map

144
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,133
if we pass at co and v it returns sure enough

145
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,300
so it follows

146
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,433
then if we were to go back to this form here

147
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,033
where we've got a struck on the right

148
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,600
but then we remove this on the left

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,866
so that this is just a plain old map

150
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,300
well that'll match because we know that a structure

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,100
is a map and this is a map on the left hand side

152
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,966
it has a key of method and a value of get

153
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,300
which this structure certainly has

154
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,600
and so that's a match

155
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,033
so what about the converse

156
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,833
if we have this strict pattern on the left hand side

157
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,900
and then over here on the right hand side

158
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,833
if we just give it a plain old map

159
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,733
that has the key method

160
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,066
and the value get

161
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,733
well that doesn't match because a map

162
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,766
isn't a structure

163
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,533
so what's the big deal here

164
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,600
maps are structures do we really care

165
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,433
indeed we do because by pattern matching on a structure

166
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,266
we can be sure

167
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:06,000
we're always working with the expected type of map

168
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,666
not just any old map

169
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,500
which makes our application code more robust

170
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,033
so back in our app

171
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:12,833
let's first change

172
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,166
how the map is initialized in our parser

173
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,033
yeah right now

174
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,966
we're just initializing it as a plain old elixir map

175
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,966
but we want it to be a seal and v s

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,500
we're just going to move that down

177
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,100
and then because we provided

178
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,566
default values for these

179
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,600
two fields when we define the structure

180
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,933
well we don't need to do this here

181
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,166
so basically what we're going to do is just

182
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
override the method path

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,133
with whatever's in the method path variables

184
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,233
so you might think of this as like a typed map

185
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,533
if we save that away

186
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,266
then back over an ix if we say recompile

187
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,366
well

188
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,866
you might be surprised to see that that still works

189
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,233
and that's because if we look at handler

190
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,466
and all these functions in our pipeline

191
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,366
that take this plain old map

192
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:54,300
while we know

193
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,166
that if this is a structure on the right hand side

194
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,033
it will match a map on the left hand side

195
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,733
back over and parser

196
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,300
we'll need to refer to this structure in other places

197
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,133
and it's tedious

198
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,300
to type survey

199
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,800
con every time

200
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,466
so instead we can set up an alias for the name

201
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,933
to do that at the top of the module we just use alias

202
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,233
we want to alias the serve

203
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,333
v module and then we can give it a name

204
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,033
we say as colon that's an option

205
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:26,300
and we want to refer to it as just

206
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,333
co and v and then down here we can remove this prefix

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,966
defining aliases

208
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:34,200
this way is so common that there's a shortcut

209
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,900
if we drop the as coal and option

210
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,700
then we get an alias that's the last part of the name

211
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,366
and that should work

212
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:42,833
and it does

213
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,300
one of the benefits of modeling

214
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,700
our conversation is a struck as compared to a map is

215
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,333
we can ensure that all the functions in our pipeline

216
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,266
always get the expected type

217
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,766
in other words we get type safety

218
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,133
let's start on our plugins module

219
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,333
in first we're going to alias service co and v

220
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,300
so we don't have to use the full prefix

221
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,800
and then down here instead of a plain old map

222
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,433
we want it to be a co and v struck

223
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,533
and we want to do the same thing here

224
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,500
notice we don't really care what's in this structure

225
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,700
so a way to do that is just to say c

226
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,766
and then just open close curly braces equals

227
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,000
and that guarantees that this is a cnv struck

228
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,433
we don't care what's inside of it

229
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,966
but we do care that it's that typed map

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,700
we'll go ahead and change this one

231
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,900
and we'll do the same thing down here

232
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,200
and I'll just take that

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
and we want to do this exact same thing

234
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:40,400
for log so now these functions will

235
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,433
only match if this argument is rco and b struck

236
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,033
they won't match if it's a plain old map

237
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,266
and putting this here also makes it clear

238
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,400
just when you look at the function head

239
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:55,100
that these functions only accept co and v instances

240
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,966
so in a way it's sort of a form of documentation

241
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,866
we need to make similar changes in the handler module

242
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,433
again we'll start by aliasing it

243
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,566
and then we'll need to update the route patterns here

244
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,700
so this is going to be co and v

245
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,100
and I'm just going to copy this

246
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,466
because we have a few of these

247
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,766
we've got to paste this into

248
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,833
and then down below

249
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,366
we also have this format response

250
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,033
and we want that to be

251
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,900
just any co and v struck

252
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,166
if we save that away should still work

253
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:31,066
now it's common for a structure to be the

254
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,933
only thing defined within a module

255
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,533
and that's what we have right now

256
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,733
however when you start modeling entities

257
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,366
of your domain as structures

258
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,033
as we did with the conversation

259
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,633
you often end up defining functions that go hand

260
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,033
in hand with the struck

261
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,533
and it makes sense to define those

262
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,766
functions in the same

263
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,133
module as the struck

264
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,333
as a simple example

265
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,700
if we look at this format response function

266
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,966
we have this string right here being interpreted

267
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,300
and there's two parts to it

268
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:56,566
well

269
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:59,333
we can tidy that up by defining a function in the co

270
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,800
and v module that returns the full status string

271
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,300
so I'm just going to cut this out of here

272
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,600
and we want it to look like this

273
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,566
on the co and v module

274
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,300
we want to be able to call a function

275
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:13,300
full status and then we'll just pass in co and v

276
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,100
then if we go over to that

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
module that has our structure defined

278
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,133
well we can add functions down

279
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:22,300
here so we can define our full status function here

280
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,033
and this is just going to return a

281
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,433
concatenated string and I'm just going to paste in

282
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,900
what I cut from over there

283
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,633
so it just interpolates

284
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
those two things the status and the reason

285
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,066
and returns a full status string

286
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,233
now for this to work

287
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,066
it needs to call this status reason function

288
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,633
so we need to move it over from handler as well

289
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,466
we'll just grab it from over here

290
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,366
and then just paste it down here

291
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,566
and we'll keep it as a private function

292
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,366
since it's only called by this function

293
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,166
and we don't really need to expose this

294
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,566
as a public function

295
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,633
so now we have a module that defines one struck

296
00:10:58,733 --> 00:10:59,833
and two functions

297
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,800
and thankfully it still works

298
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:02,766
we'll see another

299
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:05,000
example of a structure in an upcoming video
