1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,666
in the previous video we used fix is the client process

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,266
to send messages to the pledge server process

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,300
we've mimicked what we did in sex by adding some

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,100
code to the bottom of pledge server ex

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,333
it's outside of the pledge server module

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,500
just right down here

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,266
and in addition to larry moan curly

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,933
we've added two more pledges

9
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,833
for a total of five pledges

10
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:24,133
then we send a message to get the recent pledges

11
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,766
and we've got a receive block

12
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:26,900
that picks those up

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,266
and if we run that

14
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,633
well sure enough we have our five pledges

15
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:35,033
so in this context we have two processes communicating

16
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,833
all this code outside of the pledge server module

17
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,633
right here is going to run in the client process

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,633
and then the server process is this

19
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,300
listen loop that gets spawned

20
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,166
okay so now we want to encapsulate

21
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,733
creating and getting recent pledges

22
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,800
in these commented functions right here

23
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,333
so let's just start with this first one crate pledge

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,700
so right now

25
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,933
it's sending the pledge to the external service

26
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,233
and then cashing it

27
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,700
but that happens up inside of our

28
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:06,033
listen loop which runs in the server process

29
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:06,966
right here

30
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:10,366
so what the create pledge function needs to do

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,400
is just send a message to our server process

32
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:14,733
send to a pit

33
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,066
and the message is

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,466
create pledge

35
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:19,933
name and amount

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,366
and for that to work

37
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:23,133
we're going to have to pass in the pid

38
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,000
we'll pass it in as the

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,400
first argument to this function

40
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,800
so this is going to run in the client process

41
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:28,733
and then

42
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,000
this part is going to run in the server process

43
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:33,966
down here now we can call our crate pledge function

44
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,133
so we call pledge server

45
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,133
create pledge

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,166
the first argument needs to be the pid

47
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,100
of the server process and that was returned by spawn

48
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,133
so we have a pid variable already

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,500
just like that

50
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,633
we save that away

51
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,766
well it works just like it did before

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,633
now let's implement the recent pledges function

53
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,566
and I'm going to take

54
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,033
this code here with us

55
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,200
let's right up here

56
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,633
we'll uncommon it

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,900
and the body of that function

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,266
we need to do two things

59
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:07,100
we need to send a message to the server process

60
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:10,066
and then immediately wait for a response message back

61
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,133
from that server

62
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,533
so this function also needs to take a pit

63
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,266
we'll send to that pid the message

64
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,733
recent pledges telling it a send the reply back to us

65
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:20,933
and then we'll

66
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,933
have a receive which picks up the pledges

67
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,933
and instead of doing io and spec right here

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,033
I just want to return the pledges

69
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,266
and so because this pattern matches

70
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:30,566
we run this it

71
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,966
gives us the pledges and that's implicitly going to be

72
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,000
the return value of the function

73
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:36,400
recent pledges

74
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,766
now something to keep in mind here is although the sin

75
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,200
is a synchronous sending

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,233
a message is always a synchronous

77
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,500
receive is a blocking call

78
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,800
it's going to wait for a response from the server

79
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,800
so this function as a whole

80
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,000
is going to be synchronous

81
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,833
so now down here we can replace all this with

82
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
pledge server

83
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,400
recent pledges

84
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,566
passing that pid

85
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,466
and that's going to return to us the pledges

86
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,000
and I'm just going to use io

87
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,433
inspect to inspect the returned list

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
save that away

89
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,766
run it again and we still see all five pledges

90
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,466
but we only want to get recent pledges

91
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,033
which we'll say is the last

92
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,400
three pledges or

93
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,566
the first three pledges in the list

94
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,000
we'll fix that up here

95
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,600
when we get a new pledge we want to take

96
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,566
the two most recent pledges

97
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,666
and add the new pledge to the head of the list

98
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,166
so that the new state has three pledges

99
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,233
so to do that we'll add a line here

100
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,033
let's say most recent pledges

101
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:40,166
and the menu module has a take function

102
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,100
we want to take from the state that's a list

103
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,133
the two most recent pledges

104
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,066
so that's going to give us a list that has at most

105
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,700
two elements inside of it

106
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
and then we want to put

107
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
the new pledge at the head of that list

108
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,500
so here's the new pledge that we're adding

109
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,733
we're going to add it to this list

110
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,466
and that's going to give us at most

111
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,933
three elements in the list

112
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,166
save that away

113
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,433
run it again

114
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,500
and sure enough we've got grace daisy and curly

115
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,266
so now that we have this running and we feel really

116
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:09,333
comfortable with it

117
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,833
we can remove the debug statements

118
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,600
or the put as statements that print out to the screen

119
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,900
there and also will remove waiting for message

120
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,233
but that does leave us wondering

121
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:24,433
what if sending to the external service fails

122
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,800
how will the client know if the pledge was successfully

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,666
created or not

124
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,266
the client process would like to know about that

125
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,766
so we need to send a message

126
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,066
back

127
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:36,433
to the client process indicating a success or failure

128
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,400
and we actually know how to do that

129
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,466
yeah we just need to include the client's pid

130
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,800
in the message

131
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,533
so this will be the sender

132
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,666
and then we need to reply back to that sender

133
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,766
so once we have the new state figured out

134
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,833
we'll say send

135
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,233
to the sender

136
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,266
we'll give it a message tag response

137
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,566
and then we're going to send back this id variable

138
00:04:59,133 --> 00:04:59,666
again that's just

139
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,166
some unique identifier for the pledge that was created

140
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,566
then we need to change

141
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,433
this create pledge function right here

142
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,066
so it needs to send self as the first

143
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,866
element of this message tuple

144
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,300
and then just like

145
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,666
recent pledges

146
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,133
it needs to wait for a response

147
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,333
so I'll just copy that receive block right there

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,066
instead of pledges

149
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,233
this is actually going to be

150
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:20,666
we'll just call it this status

151
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,366
and now both functions are synchronous

152
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,566
then down at the bottom because

153
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,900
these now return a status

154
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,600
well I'll just add an io

155
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,566
inspect to the front of all those lines

156
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,666
and now if we run it

157
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,266
what we see we actually get pledge 4 6 9

158
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,800
and different unique ids for different pledges

159
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,866
so we get an indication that they were created

160
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,000
and then the end we see our recent pledges

161
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,633
while we're making functions

162
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,533
let's wrap or encapsulate

163
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,766
the spawn in a function named start

164
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,333
I like to put it at the top of the module here

165
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,466
we'll call it start

166
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,700
now there's paste in what we have

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,966
but before that I'm going to print out put us

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,233
starting the pled server

169
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,033
all right then we want to spawn the pledge server

170
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,133
I need to use serve

171
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,833
pledge server there to listen loop

172
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,066
just the same as before

173
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,333
and then down in the client

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,433
we can just do this

175
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,733
blood server start

176
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,633
and that works just as well

177
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,600
now that works but here's a neat trick

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,466
if at some point down the road we decide to change

179
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,566
the name of the module which we use right here

180
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,033
then we'll need to remember to change this spawn line

181
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,733
to make this more flexible

182
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:37,466
we can use underscore underscore module

183
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,666
underscore underscore

184
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,566
and at compile time this will get replaced or expanded

185
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,600
with the name of the current module

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,133
which is see dot plug server in this case

187
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,233
and that still works

188
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,333
so now if we take a look at the client code down here

189
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:53,500
well we see that

190
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,900
it's easier to play the role of a client

191
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,000
it doesn't require

192
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,366
any knowledge of how messages are structured

193
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,700
or sent back and forth

194
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,766
between the client and server processes

195
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,566
and that means we can change

196
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:07,133
the internal details of the server process

197
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,900
without affecting the client code

198
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,166
one thing you probably

199
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,900
noticed about this client code though

200
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,433
is that we have to pass the pid

201
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,900
to each of the functions

202
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,900
and since we only plan to have one

203
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,466
pledge server process running at any given time

204
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,400
passing the pit around kind of feels redundant

205
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,366
yeah the client interface would be a lot

206
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,833
simpler if we could remove

207
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,300
all references to the pid

208
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,833
so we'd like to get rid of those

209
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,366
and also right here for recent pledges

210
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,100
but then the question is how would the client functions

211
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,933
know where to send their messages

212
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:36,833
well it turns out

213
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,866
it's easy to register our server processes pid

214
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,533
under an arbitrary name

215
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,200
and then use that name

216
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,100
when sending messages to the server

217
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,333
and we'll do that up in our start function

218
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
on the process module

219
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,466
there's a function called register

220
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,333
it takes a pid

221
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,700
and then it takes a name and the name must be an atom

222
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,066
I'm going to use pledge

223
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,400
underscore server but this is totally arbitrary

224
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,966
and yes an error will be raised if another

225
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,533
process has already registered with the same name

226
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,833
and then we'll also return the pid

227
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,900
just in case the caller wants it so

228
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,033
now that we have our server process registered

229
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:12,733
under this name

230
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,066
here plug server

231
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,466
down in these functions like create pledge

232
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,633
we can remove the pid as an argument

233
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,833
and then when we call

234
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,433
send instead of sending to the pid

235
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,700
we can send to the name of the server

236
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,433
in the same way we can remove pid from recent pledges

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,533
and then we just send to that name

238
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,400
cool that still works

239
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,566
now one downside of this is if you decide to change

240
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,766
the name down the road

241
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
it's easy to forget to change

242
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,266
one occurrence

243
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,966
so you might remember to change this one

244
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,166
but then not this one

245
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,866
so here's another trick

246
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,800
we can use a module attribute

247
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,466
so that the registered name is

248
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:49,433
only in one place

249
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,133
now I'll use the module attribute at name

250
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,333
that's just something I made up

251
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,433
it's fairly conventional but you could call this

252
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,700
process name if you wanted

253
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,400
it's just an arbitrary name

254
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,233
and then we'll associate with that

255
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,033
the atom pledge server

256
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,533
so basically we just have a concept now

257
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,700
and then we can use at name

258
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,833
to reference the registered name

259
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,466
so we're going to register our pid

260
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,233
under the name pled server

261
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,000
and then we have to make sure to also change these

262
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,433
this is going to be at name

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,133
and so will this one

264
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,433
but the beauty of this is you don't have to change

265
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:23,566
these down the road if you want to change the name of

266
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:24,133
your process

267
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,333
you just change it on this one line right here

268
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,633
and everything flows through

269
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,000
so save that away it should work

270
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,433
and sure enough it does

271
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,433
now before moving on

272
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:33,966
we'll comment

273
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,266
the code at the bottom of the pledge server module

274
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:36,900
since we're just

275
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,466
using it to kick the tires of the pledge server

276
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,400
and we also don't want this code to run

277
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,266
when we fire up in in the next section
